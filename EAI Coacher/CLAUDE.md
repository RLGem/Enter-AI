# Claude Context File for AIlex — Your AI Co-Founder

## Project Overview

**Project:** AIlex — Your AI Co-Founder (Enter AI platform)
**Owner:** Rafael Livne
**Status:** Methodology & content 95% complete. Platform development not started.
**Last Updated:** February 28, 2026

**What is AIlex?** An AI-powered entrepreneurship coaching platform that guides solo founders from zero to first paying customers through a structured 6-stage "gym" model. Not a course — a co-builder. The AI coach (AIlex) uses 43 knowledge-base guides, 10 "entrepreneurial muscles," and 10 "training equipment" types to produce real deliverables while training founders simultaneously.

**Core Philosophy:** "Do first, understand later" (נעשה ונשמע). Every session produces a tangible output. Theory follows action.

## What Is Yet To Be Done

### HIGH PRIORITY — Platform Development

| Task | Status | Notes |
|:-----|:------:|:------|
| AI Coach Engine (Claude API integration) | Not started | Core runtime for coaching conversations |
| Session Memory System (persistent context) | Not started | Remember user's business, progress, outputs across sessions |
| User Dashboard (progress tracking) | Not started | Visual 6-stage journey, muscle progress |
| Deliverables Vault (document storage) | Not started | Store/retrieve all generated docs per user |
| Document Export (DOCX/PDF) | Not started | Export deliverables |
| User Authentication | Not started | Consider reusing SpeedApps JWT/WordPress stack |
| Payment System (Stripe) | Not started | Freemium gating by stage |
| Admin Dashboard | Not started | User analytics, usage monitoring |

**Platform note:** The US Market Monetization Analysis recommends reusing SpeedApps infrastructure (WordPress + REST API + JWT). SpeedApps (at `D:\My ProjectS\SpeedApps\`) has completed Sprint 1 US #1.1.1 (WordPress install, JWT auth, REST API). Estimated savings: 60-80 hrs vs. 200-300 hrs from scratch.

### HIGH PRIORITY — Content Completion

| Task | Status | Notes |
|:-----|:------:|:------|
| AI Task Cards (copy-paste Claude prompts) | Partial | Referenced in guides but not all fleshed out |
| Full EventApp case study (end-to-end) | Not started | EventApp used as example but no single document shows full journey |
| English translation of all content | Not started | Required for US market |
| Real founder case studies (3-5) | Not started | Need actual beta testers |

### MEDIUM PRIORITY — Launch Prep

| Task | Status | Notes |
|:-----|:------:|:------|
| Beta test with 5-10 real founders | Not started | Validate curriculum works end-to-end |
| Landing page / marketing site | Not started | "Gym for entrepreneurship" positioning |
| Video content (demos, testimonials) | Not started | YouTube channel |
| Community infrastructure (Discord/WhatsApp) | Not started | Accountability groups |
| Pitch deck | Not started | For partnerships and B2B |

### LOW PRIORITY — Future Enhancements

| Task | Status | Notes |
|:-----|:------:|:------|
| Domain-specific versions (e-commerce, consulting) | Not started | Vertical nApp architecture |
| Mobile app | Not started | After web MVP proves product-market fit |
| B2B licensing (accelerators, colleges) | Not started | After individual model works |
| Paid acquisition (Google/Meta ads) | Not started | After organic channels validated |
| Cohort-based training with human mentor | Not started | Premium tier |

## Relationship to SpeedApps

SpeedApps (`D:\My ProjectS\SpeedApps\`) is a separate product — an AI-powered tour/travel PWA builder. It shares:

- **Same owner** (Rafael Livne)
- **Same tech stack** (WordPress + REST API + JWT + AI chat engine)
- **Similar architecture** (bilingual HE/EN, token tracking, tiered pricing)
- **Potential shared infrastructure** for user auth, billing, admin dashboard

SpeedApps is further along technically (WordPress installed, JWT configured, Sprint 1 in progress) but less complete on content/methodology. AIlex is the opposite: rich methodology, no platform yet.

**Strategic play:** Build shared backend components once, power both products.

---

## Key Architecture Decisions (Pending)

These decisions need to be made before platform development begins:

1. **Session memory** — How does AIlex remember a founder's business, progress, and past outputs across sessions? (state.json approach from prompt V5.4 vs. database)
2. **Deliverables storage** — Where/how are generated documents stored and retrieved?
3. **Stage gating** — How does free tier limit access to Stage 1 only?
4. **AI cost management** — Token budgets per session/user? Model selection (Haiku for simple, Sonnet for complex)?
5. **Progress tracking** — How are "muscle scores" and "open debts" tracked and displayed?
6. **Platform choice** — Reuse SpeedApps WordPress stack vs. standalone (Astro, Next.js, etc.)?

---

## Guiding Principles (Established)

1. **Do first, understand later** — Every interaction starts with action, not theory
2. **Training language** — All terminology uses gym metaphor (training, muscle, set, drill, coach)
3. **AI as coach, not tool** — AI doesn't do work FOR the founder; it coaches them THROUGH it
4. **EventApp everywhere** — One unified example across all content
5. **Tangible output every session** — Not "did you understand?" but "did you produce?"
6. **Motivation first** — Quick Win in every interaction
7. **Stages 1-4 = independence** — 23 hours to paying customers
8. **AI Task Card everywhere** — 6 components: task, prompt, expected output, time saved, tip, tool
