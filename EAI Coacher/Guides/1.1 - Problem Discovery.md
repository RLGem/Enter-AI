## 1. CONTEXT

Use this guide at the very start of the founder's journey — Session 1. This is the first thing AIlex does with every founder: identify a problem worth solving. The founder may arrive with a vague idea ("I want to build an app"), a specific frustration ("scheduling is broken"), or nothing at all. AIlex's job is to extract, sharpen, and validate the problem using FUMES scoring before any solution thinking begins. Primary muscle: Pain Spotting. Equipment: Live Demo, Sharpening Questions, Form Correction, Progressive Challenge, Rapid Production, Win Celebration.

## 2. CORE CONCEPTS

### 2.1 The Problem-First Rule

The #1 mistake first-time founders make: starting with a solution ("I want to build an app for X") instead of a problem ("People struggle with Y"). Enter AI reverses this. No solution talk until the problem is validated.

**AIlex enforcement:** If a founder says "I want to build [thing]," AIlex responds: "Great energy! But before we build anything — let's make sure people actually have the problem you think they do. Tell me: who suffers from this, and how do they deal with it today?"

### 2.2 Finding Problems Worth Solving

**Three sources of good problems:**

| Source | How to Find | Quality Signal |
|--------|-----------|---------------|
| **Personal pain** | "What frustrates YOU regularly?" | You understand the problem deeply |
| **Observed pain** | "What do people around you complain about?" | Multiple people share it |
| **Industry pain** | "What's broken in your field/job?" | You have domain expertise |

**AIlex drill:** "List 5 things that frustrated you this week. Not world problems — your problems. The more specific, the better."

### 2.3 The FUMES Framework

FUMES scores a problem on 5 dimensions, each rated 1-5:

| Letter | Dimension | Question | Score 1 | Score 5 |
|--------|----------|----------|---------|---------|
| **F** | Frequency | How often does this problem occur? | Once a year | Daily |
| **U** | Urgency | How urgently do people need a solution? | "Nice to have someday" | "I need this NOW" |
| **M** | Monetizable | Will people pay to solve this? | Unlikely — free alternatives exist | Clearly — they already spend money on bad solutions |
| **E** | Expanding | Is the market growing? | Shrinking or flat | Growing fast (more people have this problem each year) |
| **S** | Solvable | Can YOU solve it with your resources? | Would need $1M+ and a team of 20 | One person with AI tools can build an MVP |

**Scoring thresholds:**
- **4.0-5.0**: Excellent problem — pursue aggressively
- **3.0-3.9**: Good problem — worth exploring, validate with conversations
- **2.0-2.9**: Weak problem — consider pivoting to a stronger one
- **Below 2.0**: Not worth pursuing — find a different problem

### 2.4 Problem Statement Formula

A good Problem Statement has 4 parts:

```
[WHO] struggles with [WHAT] because [WHY],
and currently deals with it by [CURRENT SOLUTION].
```

**Examples:**

| Weak | Strong |
|------|--------|
| "People need a better calendar" | "Freelancers with 5+ clients struggle to prevent scheduling conflicts because they manage availability across 3-4 separate tools, and currently waste 2-3 hours/week on back-and-forth emails" |
| "Small businesses need marketing help" | "Solo restaurant owners in suburbs can't attract new customers because they have zero marketing experience and $0 budget, and currently rely entirely on word-of-mouth and a neglected Facebook page" |

### 2.5 The Breadth-Before-Depth Principle

Don't fall in love with the first problem. Identify 5+ problems, score ALL of them with FUMES, THEN go deep on the winner.

```
Step 1: Brain dump 5-10 problems (20 minutes)
Step 2: Quick FUMES score for each (10 minutes)
Step 3: Pick top 2-3 (based on FUMES)
Step 4: Write Problem Statements for top 2-3
Step 5: Take the winner into Customer Discovery (Guide 2.1)
```

## 3. DECISION TABLES

### When founder arrives with different starting points:

| Founder Says | AIlex Action |
|-------------|-------------|
| "I have no idea what to build" | Start with personal pain. "What frustrated you 3 times this week?" Then expand to observed/industry pain. |
| "I want to build [specific product]" | Reverse-engineer the problem. "Why do people need this? What problem does it solve? Who has this problem?" Then FUMES test the problem. |
| "I have 10 ideas" | Great — let's score all 10 with FUMES in 15 minutes. Top 3 get Problem Statements. |
| "My problem is too small / too big" | If too small: "Who else has this? How often?" → may score low on F. If too big: "Can YOU solve this with your resources?" → may score low on S. |
| "Someone already solves this" | "Competition means the problem is real. The question is: do they solve it well enough? What's the gap?" |

### FUMES scoring adjustments:

| Situation | Adjustment |
|-----------|-----------|
| Founder's problem is B2B | Weight M (Monetizable) higher — businesses pay for solutions to real problems |
| Founder's problem is consumer | Weight F (Frequency) higher — consumers only pay for frequent, urgent problems |
| Founder has domain expertise | Bonus to S (Solvable) — they know the space, unfair advantage |
| Founder is targeting a niche | Check E (Expanding) carefully — niche might be too small to sustain a business |

### Problem Validation Summary (after Customer Discovery)

```
PROBLEM VALIDATION
==================
Problem Statement: [from above]
FUMES Score: [before conversations] → [after conversations]

CONVERSATIONS:
  Total completed: ___/5
  Confirmed the problem: ___

  2. _______________
  3. _______________

DECISION:
  [ ] Problem validated — proceed to Stage 2
  [ ] Problem partially validated — refine and do 5 more conversations
  [ ] Problem not validated — go back to FUMES, pick next problem
```

## 5. RED FLAGS

- **Founder has been brainstorming for 2+ sessions without picking a problem** → "Analysis paralysis. Let's use a timer: you have 10 minutes to pick your top problem based on FUMES. It doesn't need to be perfect — we'll validate with real people."
- **All FUMES scores below 3.0** → "None of these problems are strong enough yet. That's okay. Let's try a different angle: instead of what frustrates YOU, what do people you know spend money on that doesn't work well?"
- **Founder insists on a low-FUMES problem because they're emotionally attached** → "I see you're passionate about this. That matters. But FUMES says the market might not support it. Here's the deal: let's do 5 conversations. If 4/5 confirm the pain, we override FUMES and go."
- **Founder keeps switching problems every session** → Flag with M.1 (Mindset guide). "We've explored 3 different problems. That's creative — but none have been tested. Pick one. Commit for 5 conversations. If it's wrong, we pivot with data, not feelings."

## 6. EXAMPLES

### Product Example: Task Management SaaS

**Founder:** "I want to build a better to-do app."
**AIlex:** "What specific problem does your to-do app solve that Todoist, Notion, and TickTick don't?"
**Founder:** "Well... freelancers manage tasks across multiple clients and it gets messy."

**FUMES:**
- F=5 (daily problem for multi-client freelancers)
- U=3 (painful but not emergency)
- M=4 (freelancers will pay $10-30/mo for workflow tools)
- E=4 (freelance economy growing 15% YoY)
- S=5 (one person can build this)
- **Average: 4.2** ✅

**Problem Statement:** "Freelancers managing 5+ clients struggle to track deliverables, deadlines, and communications across multiple projects because each client uses different tools (Slack, email, Trello), and currently deal with it by maintaining messy spreadsheets and hoping they don't miss a deadline."

### Service Example: Social Media for Restaurants

**Founder:** "I want to help restaurants with social media."
**AIlex:** "What specific problem do restaurants have with social media?"
**Founder:** "They know they should post but they don't know what to post or when."

**FUMES:**
- F=5 (they should post daily, but don't)
- U=3 (not urgent, but important for business)
- M=4 (restaurants spend $500-2,000/mo on marketing when they have budget)
- E=3 (stable market, not rapidly growing)
- S=5 (one person with AI tools can do this easily)
- **Average: 4.0** ✅

**Problem Statement:** "Independent restaurant owners know social media drives foot traffic but can't maintain a consistent presence because they have no marketing experience and work 12-hour days in the kitchen, and currently deal with it by posting sporadically or not at all."
