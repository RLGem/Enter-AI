## 1. CONTEXT

Use this guide when a founder has a validated problem (passed Stage 1) and needs to generate solution ideas. Most founders jump to their first idea. This guide forces breadth before depth — generate 8+ ideas, then select the best one. The selection is based on founder capability, market fit, and speed to test — NOT on how "cool" the idea sounds. Primary muscle: Focused Creativity. Equipment: Live Demo, Progressive Challenge, Sharpening Questions, Alternative Planning, Rapid Production, Win Celebration.

## 2. CORE CONCEPTS

### 2.1 The Crazy 8's Method

From Google Ventures Design Sprint. Adapted for solo founders:

```
RULES:
- 8 ideas in 8 minutes (1 minute per idea)
- Sketch or write — doesn't matter
- NO judgment during generation (quantity > quality)
- Wild ideas welcome (they spark practical ones)
- After 8 minutes: STOP generating, START evaluating
```

**Why 8?** Because idea #1 is always the obvious one. Ideas #4-8 are where creativity kicks in. The best idea is usually #5, #6, or #7 — the one that combines the obvious with the unexpected.

### 2.2 Solution Spectrum

Push founders to think across the full spectrum:

| Type | Example | Speed to Test | Cost |
|------|---------|--------------|------|
| Manual service | "I'll do it for them by hand" | 1 day | $0 |
| Spreadsheet/template | "A structured Google Sheet" | 2 hours | $0 |
| No-code app | "A Notion template / Airtable base" | 1 day | $0 |
| Simple web app | "A landing page with a form" | 2-4 hours | $0 |
| Full web/mobile app | "A React app with backend" | 2-4 weeks | $0-100 |
| AI-powered tool | "An AI that does X automatically" | 1-3 days | $20-50/mo API |
| Physical product | "A printed checklist/workbook" | 1 week | $50-200 |
| Community/marketplace | "A group where X connects with Y" | 1 day | $0 |

**AIlex insight:** The best MVPs are often boring. Zappos started by buying shoes from stores and reselling them. Airbnb started with air mattresses. Don't build the spaceship — build the bicycle first.

### 2.3 Idea Selection Criteria

After generating 8+ ideas, score each on three dimensions:

| Criterion | Question | Weight |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| **Can I build it?** | Can you create a testable version in 1-2 weeks with your skills + AI tools? | 40% |
| **Does it solve the validated pain?** | Does it directly address what customers told you in Stage 1? | 40% |
| **Can I test it cheaply?** | Can you put it in front of 10 people for < $100? | 20% |

**Simple scoring:** Each idea gets Yes/No on each criterion. Pick the idea with 3 Yes's. If multiple qualify, pick the one you're most excited about.

### 2.4 The "How Might We" Reframe

Before brainstorming, reframe the problem as a "How Might We" (HMW) question:

```
Problem: "Freelancers waste 3 hours/week organizing tasks across multiple tools"

HMW: "How might we help freelancers manage all their clients
      in one place in under 10 minutes per day?"
```

HMW is specific enough to focus ideation but open enough to allow creative solutions. AIlex generates the HMW from the Problem Statement.

## 3. DECISION TABLES

| Founder Situation | AIlex Action |
|-------------------|-------------|
| Generates only 2-3 ideas | "You're self-censoring. Turn off the filter. What's the craziest, most unrealistic way to solve this? Sometimes ridiculous ideas inspire practical ones." |
| All ideas are software | "What if you couldn't code at all? What would you build? A service? A template? A community? Some of the best businesses aren't apps." |
| Picks the most complex idea | "That's ambitious. But can you test it this week? If not, what's the simplest version that proves the same point?" |
| Can't choose between ideas | "You don't need the perfect idea. You need a testable idea. Pick one, test it in Stage 2.2 (Pretotyping). If it fails, come back and pick another." |
| Wants to combine 3 ideas into one | "Combining = complexity. Your MVP should do ONE thing well. Pick the strongest single idea. The others become Version 2 features." |

## 5. RED FLAGS

- **Founder falls in love with one idea before brainstorming** → "I know you're excited about this idea. Hold it gently. Let's generate 7 alternatives. Your original might still win — but only after it survives comparison."
- **Founder generates ideas that don't connect to the validated problem** → "These are creative — but let's check: which of your customer conversations supports this idea? If none, it's a solution looking for a problem."
- **Founder wants to build ALL the ideas** → "That's 8 businesses, not 1. Pick the strongest. Build it. Validate it. The others aren't going anywhere."
