## 1. CONTEXT

Use this guide when the founder has a working business and needs to assess the full opportunity: market size, competitive landscape, and strategic positioning. At Stage 6, this isn't theoretical — the founder has real customers and real data. The assessment helps them decide: double down, expand, pivot, or stay the course. AIlex also uses this guide when a founder at any stage asks "Is this market big enough?" or "Who are my competitors?" Primary muscle: Wide Vision + Number Reading. Equipment: Live Demo, Data Insights, Sharpening Questions, Mirror, Alternative Planning, Rapid Production.

## 2. CORE CONCEPTS

### 2.1 Market Sizing (TAM / SAM / SOM)

```
TAM (Total Addressable Market):
  Everyone who COULD use your solution
  "All 59 million freelancers in the US"

SAM (Serviceable Addressable Market):
  The segment you CAN realistically reach
  "500,000 freelancers who manage 3+ clients and use digital tools"

SOM (Serviceable Obtainable Market):
  What you can capture in 1-2 years
  "2,000 freelancers in your niche through your current channels"

REVENUE CALCULATION:
  SOM × Price × Time = Annual Revenue Potential
  2,000 × $39/mo × 12 months = $936,000/year
```

**How to estimate market size:**

| Method | Approach | Accuracy |
|--------|---------|----------|
| **Top-down** | Start with industry reports, narrow down | Looks big, often too optimistic |
| **Bottom-up** ✅ | Count actual potential customers in your channels | Realistic, preferred by investors |
| **Value theory** | Count the value being spent on solving this problem today | Good for replacement markets |

**Bottom-up example:**
- Reddit r/freelance: 800K members. 5% are your target = 40,000
- LinkedIn freelancer groups: 200K. 3% target = 6,000
- Indie Hackers: 100K. 10% target = 10,000
- Total reachable: ~56,000 potential customers
- Realistic conversion: 3-5% over 2 years = 1,700-2,800 customers
- Revenue: 2,000 × $39 × 12 = $936K/year

### 2.2 Competitive Analysis

**Step 1: Find ALL competitors** (not just the obvious ones)

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-----------|---------|
| **Direct competitors** | Solve the same problem the same way | Another freelancer task tool |
| **Indirect competitors** | Solve the same problem differently | Generic project management (Asana, Trello) |
| **Alternative solutions** | What people do instead of buying | Spreadsheets, sticky notes, memory |
| **Potential competitors** | Could enter your market easily | Big platforms adding your feature |

**Step 2: Feature Comparison Matrix**

```
FEATURE COMPARISON:
                     You    Comp A    Comp B    Comp C    Free Alt
Client grouping       ✅      ❌        ✅        ✅       ❌ (manual)
Smart reminders       ✅      ✅        ❌        ❌       ❌
Freelancer-focused    ✅      ❌        ❌        ✅       ❌
Price                 $39     $25       $49       $29      $0
Mobile app            ❌      ✅        ✅        ❌       N/A
Integrations          3       12        8         2        N/A
Free tier             ✅      ❌        ✅        ✅       ✅
```

**Step 3: Positioning**

Where do you sit relative to competitors?

```
                    SIMPLE ──────────────────── POWERFUL
                    │                              │
     CHEAP          │   ┌──────┐                   │
       │            │   │ YOU  │    ┌────────┐     │
       │            │   └──────┘    │ Comp A │     │
       │            │               └────────┘     │
       │            │                              │
       │            │         ┌────────┐           │
       │            │         │ Comp B │           │
       │            │         └────────┘           │
    EXPENSIVE       │                              │
                    │                              │
```

**Your position = your differentiation.** Own it.

### 2.3 Competitive Moats

A moat protects your business from competitors:

| Moat Type | What It Is | Solo Founder Version |
|-----------|-----------|---------------------|
| **Network effects** | Product gets better with more users | Community, collaboration features, shared templates |
| **Data advantage** | You have data others don't | Customer insights from interviews, usage data |
| **Switching costs** | Hard to leave once you're in | Customer data stored in your tool, integrations, workflows |
| **Brand** | People trust and prefer you | Authority content, community reputation, personal brand |
| **Speed** | You ship faster than anyone | Solo = fast decisions. No committees, no bureaucracy |
| **Niche expertise** | You know the customer better | You were the customer (or spent 100 hours talking to them) |
| **Cost advantage** | You can operate cheaper | AI tools, no team overhead, free tiers |

**For solo founders:** Your primary moats are Speed, Niche Expertise, and Community. Build these intentionally.

### 2.5 Strategic Options

After assessing the opportunity, the founder has four strategic paths:

| Path | When to Choose | Action |
|------|---------------|--------|
| **Double down** | Market is large, position is strong, growing | Invest more in current strategy. Hire. Scale. |
| **Expand** | Current market tapped, adjacent opportunities exist | Add new customer segment, new feature set, or new geography |
| **Niche deeper** | Broad market, lots of competition | Focus on a specific sub-segment where you can dominate |
| **Pivot** | Market too small, competition too strong, or PMF weak | See P.1 Pivot Decision Framework |

---

## 3. DECISION TABLES

### Market size reality check:

| SOM (Year 1 Revenue) | Assessment | Action |
|----------------------|-----------|--------|
| < $50K/year | Hobby-level market | Either niche deeper or pivot to adjacent market |
| $50K-$200K/year | Lifestyle business | Can support solo founder. Bootstrap-friendly |
| $200K-$1M/year | Solid small business | Can support small team. Consider light fundraising |
| $1M+/year | Significant opportunity | Attractive to investors if you want to raise |

### Competitive landscape reactions:

| Situation | What It Means | Action |
|-----------|-------------|--------|
| No competitors | Either a huge opportunity or there's no market | Validate demand harder. Why has nobody built this? |
| 1-3 competitors | Good sign — market exists, not saturated | Differentiate clearly. Be better at one thing |
| 5-10 competitors | Crowded. Need strong positioning. | Find an underserved niche within the market |
| Big player entering your space | Dangerous but not fatal | Move faster, serve your niche better, deepen relationships |
| Competitor raised huge round | They'll spend on growth, not necessarily on your niche | Focus on what you do best. Don't compete on their terms |

## 5. RED FLAGS

- **Founder says "we have no competitors"** → "Every business has competitors — even if it's just 'doing nothing' or 'using a spreadsheet.' Find 5 alternatives your customers could use instead. Understanding competition makes you stronger."
- **Founder overestimates market size** → "Your TAM is $10B. Great. But your SOM — what you can actually capture in year 1 — is $100K. That's the number that matters right now. Build from the bottom up."
- **Founder ignores big competitor entering the space** → "Google just launched a similar feature. Don't panic — but don't ignore it. Your advantage: you move faster, you know the niche better, and you care more. Double down on what makes you different."
- **Founder obsesses over competition instead of customers** → "You've spent 3 hours researching competitors this week and 0 hours talking to customers. Competitors don't pay your bills. Customers do."
- **Market is too small but founder refuses to pivot** → "Your SOM calculation shows 200 potential customers at $39/month. That's $94K/year maximum. Can you live on that? If not, we need to expand the market definition or find a bigger adjacent problem."

## 6. EXAMPLES

### Product: Freelancer Task Tool

**Market sizing (bottom-up):**
- Reddit r/freelance + r/digitalnomad: target audience 60K
- LinkedIn freelancer groups: target 15K
- Indie Hackers + Twitter: target 10K
- Total reachable: ~85K
- SOM (Year 1): 2,000 customers × $39 × 12 = $936K

**Competitors:** Asana (too complex), Trello (too generic), Monday.com (too expensive), Notion (not specialized)
**Differentiator:** Built specifically for freelancers managing multiple clients. No other tool does this.
**Moat:** Niche expertise (founder is a freelancer) + community (active in r/freelance)
**Decision:** Double down. Market is large enough, competition doesn't serve the niche.

### Service: Restaurant Social Media

**Market sizing (bottom-up):**
- Independent restaurants in Austin, TX: ~3,200
- Without a marketing person: ~60% = 1,920
- Would pay for social media: ~30% = 576
- SOM (Year 1): 15 clients × $800 × 12 = $144K

**Competitors:** 3 local agencies (expensive, $2K+/month), 2 freelancers (inconsistent quality), DIY (most common)
**Differentiator:** Restaurant-specific expertise + affordable pricing + proven results with monthly reports
**Moat:** Local relationships + restaurant niche knowledge + portfolio of results
**Decision:** Niche deeper. Become THE restaurant social media person in Austin. Expand to other cities later.
