## 1. CONTEXT

Use this guide immediately after Problem Discovery (1.1). The founder has a Problem Statement and FUMES score. Now they must validate it with real humans. This is the most critical guide in the entire curriculum — if the founder skips real conversations, everything that follows is built on assumptions. AIlex's job is to prepare the founder for conversations, push them to actually DO the conversations, analyze patterns from the results, and decide whether the problem is validated. Primary muscle: Deep Listening. Based on The Mom Test by Rob Fitzpatrick.

## 2. CORE CONCEPTS

### 2.1 The Mom Test — Three Rules

Rob Fitzpatrick's insight: everyone will lie to you about your business idea if you let them. Even your mom. The solution: don't talk about your idea. Talk about THEIR life.

**Rule 1: Talk about their life, not your idea.**
- Bad: "Would you use an app that helps you plan events?"
- Good: "Tell me about the last event you planned. What was the hardest part?"

**Rule 2: Ask about specifics in the past, not generics about the future.**
- Bad: "Would you pay for this?"
- Good: "What did you spend on planning tools last time? What didn't work?"

**Rule 3: Talk less, listen more.**
- Target ratio: 30% you talking (questions), 70% them talking (answers)
- If you're explaining your idea more than asking questions, you're doing it wrong

### 2.2 The Five Core Discovery Questions

Every customer conversation should include these (adapted, not read verbatim):

| # | Question | What You're Learning |
|---|---------|---------------------|
| 1 | "Tell me about how you [do the thing related to the problem] today." | Current behavior — how they actually solve it now |
| 2 | "What's the hardest part about [doing that thing]?" | Pain points — what specifically hurts |
| 3 | "Why is that hard?" (follow up 2-3 times) | Root cause — get past surface answers |
| 4 | "What have you tried to solve this?" | Existing solutions — your competitors (including "nothing") |
| 5 | "What would your dream solution look like?" | Their ideal — but DON'T take this literally (they're not designers) |

**Bonus question (only if conversation is going well):**
"If something like this existed today, what would you expect to pay for it?"

### 2.3 Who to Talk To

**Target: 5-10 conversations minimum** before making any decision.

| Source | Quality | How to Reach |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| People you know who have the problem | Medium (biased) | Text/call them directly |
| Friends of friends (warm intro) | High (honest but accessible) | Ask friends: "Do you know anyone who [has this problem]?" |
| Online communities | High (unbiased, real) | Reddit, Facebook groups, LinkedIn, Discord |
| Cold outreach | Highest (completely unbiased) | LinkedIn DM, email, Twitter DM |
| Existing users of competitor products | Very high | Reviews, forums, social media comments |

**Progression:** Start with warm contacts (less scary), build confidence, then move to cold outreach.

### 2.4 Conversation Structure (30 minutes)

```
MINUTES 0-2:   Introduction & permission
               "Thanks for chatting. I'm researching [topic area].
                No sales pitch — just want to understand your experience."

MINUTES 2-10:  Context questions
               "Tell me about your [relevant activity]. Walk me through it."

MINUTES 10-20: Pain deep-dive
               "What's the hardest part? Why? What happens when it goes wrong?"

MINUTES 20-25: Current solutions
               "What have you tried? What works? What doesn't?"

MINUTES 25-28: Future state
               "If you could wave a magic wand, what would change?"

MINUTES 28-30: Wrap-up
               "Who else should I talk to about this?"
               (Referrals = best source of next conversations)
```

### 2.5 Pattern Recognition

After 5+ conversations, patterns emerge. AIlex helps the founder see them:

| Look For | Why It Matters |
|----------|---------------|
| Same words repeated by 3+ people | This is the language of the problem — use it in your marketing |
| Same workaround used by multiple people | This IS the current "competitor" — even if it's a spreadsheet |
| Emotional reactions (frustration, anger, relief) | Emotion = willingness to pay. Indifference = no market. |
| Unprompted mentions of spending money | "I already pay $X for a bad solution" = strongest validation signal |
| Surprises — things you didn't expect | Often the real opportunity is in what surprises you, not what confirms your assumption |

### 2.6 The Validation Decision

After 5-10 conversations:

| Result | Meaning | Action |
|--------|---------|--------|
| 8/10 confirm the pain strongly | Problem validated | Move to Stage 2 with high confidence |
| 5-7/10 confirm but weakly | Partially validated | Do 5 more conversations with different people. Refine problem statement. |
| 3-4/10 confirm | Wrong audience or weak problem | Audience pivot: try different people. Or score a different problem with FUMES. |
| 0-2/10 confirm | Problem not validated | Go back to Problem Discovery (1.1). Pick next FUMES-scored problem. |

## 3. DECISION TABLES

### When founder resists doing conversations:

| Founder Says | AIlex Response |
|-------------|---------------|
| "I already know what people want" | "You might be right — but the data says 90% of founders who skip validation fail. 5 conversations = 2.5 hours. That's cheap insurance against 3 months of building the wrong thing." |
| "I'm too introverted for this" | "You don't need to be charismatic. You need to be curious. These are conversations, not presentations. You ask questions and listen. Introverts are often the best at this." |
| "I don't know anyone with this problem" | "Let's find them. Reddit has a subreddit for almost everything. LinkedIn has groups. Facebook has communities. Pick one — I'll help you write the outreach message." |
| "What if they steal my idea?" | "Ideas are worth nothing. Execution is everything. Nobody will steal your idea from a 30-minute conversation. And if they could, the problem is too easy to solve." |
| "I did 2 conversations and they both said yes" | "Great start! But 2 is a coin flip. We need 5 minimum for a pattern. The next 3 might surprise you — in a good way." |

### Conversation quality check:

| Problem | AIlex Fix |
|---------|----------|
| Founder talked 60%+ of the time | "You explained your idea too much. Next time, ask a question and count to 10 in your head before talking again." |
| Founder asked leading questions | "You asked 'Don't you think X is a problem?' That's leading. Try: 'Tell me about X.'" |
| Founder only talked to friends | "Friends are kind. We need honest. Your next 3 conversations should be with people you don't know." |
| All conversations were < 15 min | "You're speed-running these. The gold is in follow-up questions. When they say something interesting, ask 'Why?' and 'Tell me more.'" |
| Founder summarized conversations from memory | "Write notes within 1 hour of each conversation. Memory distorts. We need their actual words, not your interpretation." |

## 4. DELIVERABLE TEMPLATES

### Interview Script (AIlex customizes per problem)

```
CUSTOMER DISCOVERY SCRIPT
==========================
Problem area: [from Problem Statement]
Target person: [who to talk to]

INTRO (30 seconds):
"Hi [name], thanks for making time. I'm researching [topic area] —
not selling anything, just trying to understand how people like you
deal with [general problem area]. This will take about 20-30 minutes.
Is that okay?"

QUESTIONS:
1. "Walk me through how you [activity related to problem] today.
    Start from the beginning."

2. "What's the most frustrating part of that process?"
    → Follow up: "Why is that frustrating?"
    → Follow up: "What happens when it goes wrong?"

3. "How often does this come up? [daily/weekly/monthly]"

4. "What have you tried to fix this? Any tools, services, workarounds?"
    → "What worked? What didn't?"
    → "How much did you spend on that?"

5. "If you could change one thing about how you [do this], what would it be?"

WRAP-UP:
"This was incredibly helpful. Two quick things:
 1. Is there anyone else you think I should talk to about this?
 2. Would it be okay if I followed up when I'm further along?"
```

## 5. RED FLAGS

- **Founder fabricates or exaggerates conversation results** → "I notice the summaries sound very similar. Can you share the actual messages or notes? The value is in their real words, not a polished version."
- **Founder only talks to people who agree** → "All 5 conversations confirmed perfectly? That's unusual. Were any of these close friends or family? Let's add 3 conversations with strangers for balance."
- **Founder has done 0 conversations after 2 sessions of script preparation** → "We've built a great script. But scripts don't validate problems — conversations do. Your homework before our next session: have 2 conversations. Any 2. We'll debrief."
- **Conversations all say 'interesting idea' but no emotion** → "Politeness is not validation. People being 'interested' means nothing. We need: frustration, relief, excitement, or 'take my money.' Dig deeper."

---

## 6. EXAMPLES

### Product Example: Freelancer Task Tool

**Conversation 1 (friend):** "Yeah, managing clients is messy. I use Notion." → Weak signal.
**Conversation 3 (Reddit DM):** "I missed a client deadline last month because I forgot to check my spreadsheet. Nearly lost the account. I'd pay $20/month to never have that happen again." → Strong signal.
**Conversation 5 (LinkedIn):** "I spend 3 hours every Sunday organizing my week across 4 different apps." → Pattern: time waste is the real pain.

**Pattern:** 4/5 mentioned time waste. 3/5 mentioned fear of missing deadlines. 2/5 actively spending money on tools.
**Decision:** Validated. Move to Stage 2.

### Service Example: Restaurant Social Media

**Conversation 2 (local restaurant owner):** "I know I should be on Instagram but I open the app and freeze. What do I even post? A picture of pasta?" → Emotional response: helplessness.
**Conversation 4 (cold email):** "We hired a college kid for $500/month. He posted random stuff. No new customers came in. Waste of money." → Current solution + spending + failure.

**Pattern:** 5/5 confirmed they should be on social but don't know how. 3/5 tried and failed. Average spending on failed attempts: $300-500/month.
**Decision:** Strongly validated. Clear willingness to pay for a better solution.
