## 1. CONTEXT

Use this guide after the founder has selected a solution idea (1.2 Crazy 8's). Before building ANYTHING, the founder must test demand with a pretotype — a fake or minimal version that measures real behavior (clicks, signups, payments), not opinions. Coined by Alberto Savoia (Google's first Engineering Director). The core question: "Would people USE this?" measured by ACTIONS, not WORDS. Primary muscle: Reality Testing. Equipment: Live Demo, Sharpening Questions, Form Correction, Alternative Planning, Rapid Production, Data Insights.

## 2. CORE CONCEPTS

### 2.1 Pretotype vs Prototype vs MVP

| | Pretotype | Prototype | MVP |
|--|----------|-----------|-----|
| **Purpose** | Test demand (do people want it?) | Test feasibility (can we build it?) | Test value (does it work?) |
| **Fidelity** | Fake / paper / smoke screen | Basic working version | Minimal real product |
| **Build time** | Hours | Days–weeks | Weeks–months |
| **What you learn** | Would people buy this? | Can we build this? | Do people keep using this? |
| **Stage** | 2 (Demand Proof) | 3 (Working Product) | 3 (Working Product) |

### 2.2 The Five Pretotype Types

| Type | What It Is | How It Works | Best For |
|------|-----------|-------------|----------|
| **Fake Door** | A landing page for a product that doesn't exist | Create LP with "Sign Up" or "Buy Now" button. Measure clicks. Product doesn't exist yet. | Digital products, SaaS, apps |
| **Concierge** | Do the service manually before automating | Deliver the value by hand to 3-5 customers. Don't build tech. | Service businesses, AI tools |
| **Wizard of Oz** | Looks automated, but a human does the work behind the scenes | User thinks they're using software, but you're manually processing | Complex products that need to "feel" real |
| **One-Night Stand** | Run a one-time event or service | Host one workshop, deliver one batch, run one cohort | Courses, events, group services |
| **Pinocchio** | Physical mock-up of a product that doesn't work | 3D-printed case, cardboard prototype, Figma mockup | Physical products, hardware |

### 2.3 Running a Pretotype Test

```
Step 1: HYPOTHESIS
"I believe [target audience] will [take action]
 when presented with [pretotype]."

Step 2: BUILD (< 1 day)
Create the simplest version that tests the hypothesis.

Step 3: MEASURE
- Primary metric: Conversion Rate (CVR)
  = (people who took action) ÷ (people who saw it) × 100

Step 4: DECIDE
- CVR > 10%: Strong signal → Go to Stage 2.3 (Landing Page)
- CVR 5-10%: Moderate signal → Improve messaging, test again
- CVR < 5%: Weak signal → Solution Pivot or Audience Pivot
```

### 2.4 Traffic Sources for Pretotype Tests

You need eyeballs on your pretotype. Free options:

| Source | Expected Volume | Quality | Effort |
|--------|----------------|---------|--------|
| Personal network (text/email 20 people) | 15-20 views | Medium (biased) | 5 min |
| Facebook/Reddit groups | 50-500 views | High (relevant) | 30 min to post |
| LinkedIn post | 100-1,000 views | Medium-High | 15 min |
| Twitter/X thread | 50-5,000 views | Variable | 20 min |
| $20 Facebook/Instagram ad | 200-1,000 views | High (targetable) | 30 min to set up |

**Minimum sample size:** 50+ people seeing the pretotype before drawing conclusions. Below 50, results are noise.

### 2.5 Measuring Real Demand vs. Fake Demand

| Real Demand (trust this) | Fake Demand (don't trust this) |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Clicked "Buy Now" / "Sign Up" | Said "cool idea!" |
| Gave their email address | Liked your social media post |
| Asked "when will this be ready?" | Told you "I'd definitely use this" |
| Shared it with someone else | Nodded politely |
| Pre-paid or put down a deposit | Said "let me know when it launches" |

**AIlex mantra:** "Don't count compliments. Count actions."

## 3. DECISION TABLES

### Choosing the right pretotype type:

| Business Type | Recommended Pretotype | Why |
|--------------|----------------------|-----|
| SaaS / digital product | Fake Door (landing page) | Cheapest, fastest demand signal |
| Service business | Concierge (do it manually for 3 clients) | Proves value AND demand simultaneously |
| AI tool | Wizard of Oz (you do the AI's job manually) | Tests if people want the output, before building the AI |
| Physical product | Pinocchio (3D render or mockup + preorder page) | Tests willingness to pay before manufacturing |
| Course / workshop | One-Night Stand (run it once, free or paid) | Tests if people show up and engage |
| Marketplace | Concierge (manually match 5 buyers and 5 sellers) | Tests if both sides of the market exist |

### Post-test decisions:

| CVR | Interpretation | AIlex Action |
|-----|---------------|-------------|
| > 15% | Exceptional — strong demand | "This is very strong. Move to Landing Page Testing (2.3) immediately. You've got something." |
| 10-15% | Good — proceed with confidence | "Solid signal. Let's build a proper landing page and scale this test." |
| 5-10% | Promising — optimize | "There's interest but it's not explosive. Let's tweak: try a different headline, different audience, or different channel. Then retest." |
| 2-5% | Weak — investigate | "Some interest, but not enough. Two possibilities: wrong audience or wrong message. Let's check both before pivoting the solution." |
| < 2% | Very weak — likely need to pivot | "Honest conversation: less than 2% acted. This might mean the solution doesn't excite people, or we're reaching the wrong audience. Let's review our options." |

## 4. DELIVERABLE TEMPLATES

### Pretotype Test Plan

```
PRETOTYPE TEST PLAN
====================
Date: [date]
Solution idea: [from Crazy 8's]
Pretotype type: [Fake Door / Concierge / Wizard of Oz / One-Night Stand / Pinocchio]

HYPOTHESIS:
"I believe [who] will [action] when they see [pretotype],
 at a rate of at least [X]%."

BUILD:
  What I'll create: _______________________________
  Time to build: ___ hours
  Cost: $___

TRAFFIC:
  Source: _______________________________
  Expected reach: ___ people
  Timeline: ___ days

MEASURE:
  Primary metric: _________ (target: __%)
  How I'll track: _______________________________

DECISION CRITERIA:
  GO if: CVR > ___%
  OPTIMIZE if: CVR ___-___%
  PIVOT if: CVR < ___%
```

### Pretotype Results

```
PRETOTYPE RESULTS
==================
Test ran: [dates]
Total reached: ___ people
Action taken: ___ people
CVR: ___%

DECISION:
[ ] GO → move to Landing Page (2.3)
[ ] OPTIMIZE → change [message / audience / channel] and retest
[ ] PIVOT → revisit Crazy 8's (1.2) for different solution
[ ] DIG DEEPER → need more conversations (back to 2.1)
```

## 5. RED FLAGS

- **Founder skips pretotyping and jumps to building** → "I know building is more fun than testing. But a pretotype takes 2 hours. Building the wrong product takes 2 months. Which risk do you prefer?"
- **Founder tests with only 10 people** → "10 people is too small to draw conclusions. 3 signups out of 10 could be luck. We need at least 50 views. Let's expand the test."
- **Founder measures likes instead of actions** → "50 likes and 0 signups means 50 people were polite. We need signups, clicks, or payments. Let's redesign the test with a real CTA."
- **Founder runs test for 1 day and concludes** → "Give it at least 3-5 days and 50+ views. Some channels are slow. Let's wait for meaningful data."

## 6. EXAMPLES

### Product: Freelancer Task Tool

**Pretotype:** Fake Door — simple Carrd page: "TaskFlow: Manage all your freelance clients in one place. Coming soon — join the waitlist." Posted in 3 freelancer Facebook groups and r/freelance.
**Result:** 180 views, 22 signups = **12.2% CVR** ✅
**Decision:** GO → move to Landing Page Testing

### Service: Restaurant Social Media

**Pretotype:** Concierge — offered 3 local restaurants: "I'll manage your Instagram for 1 week, free. I'll post daily, you just send me 1 phone photo per day."
**Result:** 3/3 agreed. After 1 week: 2/3 asked "how much to continue?"
**Decision:** GO → define service package and pricing (Stage 4)
