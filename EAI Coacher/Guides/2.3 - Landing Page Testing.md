## 1. CONTEXT

Use this guide after the pretotype (2.2) shows positive signal (CVR > 5%). Now the founder builds a real landing page — still no product, but a professional page that converts visitors into leads or early customers. The landing page is the founder's first "sales machine" and the foundation for everything that follows. AIlex helps write copy, structure the page, deploy it, and measure conversion. Primary muscle: Reality Testing + Direct Persuasion. Equipment: Live Demo, Form Correction, Rapid Production, Data Insights, Progressive Challenge, Mirror.

## 2. CORE CONCEPTS

### 2.1 Landing Page Anatomy — The 5-Second Rule

A visitor decides whether to stay or leave in 5 seconds. In those 5 seconds, they must understand:
1. **What is this?** (headline)
2. **Is it for me?** (subheadline)
3. **What should I do?** (CTA)

### 2.2 Copywriting Rules for Founders

| Rule | Bad | Good |
|------|-----|------|
| Lead with pain, not features | "AI-powered task management platform" | "Stop losing clients to missed deadlines" |
| Use their words (from interviews) | "Optimize your workflow efficiency" | "Stop wasting 3 hours every Sunday organizing your week" |
| Be specific | "Save time" | "Save 3 hours per week" |
| One CTA per page | "Sign up, Follow us, Read our blog, Watch demo" | "Get Early Access" (one button, repeated) |
| Social proof > claims | "We're the best tool" | "127 freelancers already on the waitlist" |

### 2.3 Landing Page Tools (Free / Low-Cost)

| Tool | Cost | Build Time | Best For |
|------|------|-----------|----------|
| **Carrd** | Free (1 site) / $19/yr | 30 min | Simple, beautiful one-pagers |
| **Framer** | Free tier | 1-2 hours | Designer-quality pages |
| **Typedream** | Free tier | 30 min | Quick, template-based |
| **Notion + Super.so** | $12/mo | 1 hour | If you already use Notion |
| **Claude Code / Bolt / Lovable** | AI costs only | 1-2 hours | Custom, unique designs |
| **WordPress** | Free (with hosting) | 2-3 hours | If you need a blog later |

**AIlex default:** Use Carrd for speed. If the founder wants custom, use Claude Code or Bolt. Don't overthink the tool — the COPY matters more than the design.

### 2.4 Conversion Rate Benchmarks

| Metric | Poor | Average | Good | Excellent |
|--------|------|---------|------|-----------|
| LP visit → email signup | < 3% | 3-8% | 8-15% | > 15% |
| LP visit → waitlist | < 5% | 5-10% | 10-20% | > 20% |
| LP visit → purchase | < 1% | 1-3% | 3-5% | > 5% |

### 2.5 A/B Testing for Solo Founders

You don't need fancy tools. Test ONE thing at a time:

| Test | How | Timeline |
|------|-----|---------|
| **Headline A vs B** | Run headline A for 3 days, switch to B for 3 days. Compare CVR. | 1 week |
| **CTA text** | "Get Early Access" vs "Join Free" vs "Start Now" | 1 week |
| **Price point** | Show $29 for 3 days, then $39 for 3 days | 1 week |

**Minimum for each variant:** 100+ visitors before comparing. Below 100, it's noise.

### 2.6 Traffic Strategy for Landing Page

| Phase | Source | Expected Volume |
|-------|--------|----------------|
| Day 1-3 | Personal network (text, email, social post) | 30-50 visits |
| Day 4-7 | Relevant online communities (Reddit, FB groups, Discord) | 50-200 visits |
| Day 7-14 | Cold outreach (LinkedIn, Twitter, forums) | 50-100 visits |
| Optional | $20-50 paid ad (Facebook or Google) | 100-500 visits |

**Target:** 200+ visits in 2 weeks. If you can't get 200 people to LOOK at your page, you have a distribution problem that will only get worse.

---

## 3. DECISION TABLES

### LP performance diagnosis:

| Symptom | Likely Problem | Fix |
|---------|---------------|-----|
| Lots of visits, low CVR (< 3%) | Headline doesn't resonate | Rewrite headline using customer interview language |
| Few visits, high CVR | Good page, bad distribution | Focus on traffic: post in more communities, try paid ads |
| High bounce rate (< 10 sec on page) | Hero section fails 5-second test | Simplify: bigger headline, clearer subheadline, fewer distractions |
| People scroll but don't sign up | CTA is weak or hidden | Make CTA more prominent, add urgency ("limited beta spots") |
| Signups but fake emails | Attracting tire-kickers | Tighten targeting: more specific headline, niche communities |

### When to proceed vs. iterate:

| CVR After 200+ Visits | Decision |
|-----------------------|----------|
| > 10% signup | Move to Stage 3 (build MVP). You have demand. |
| 5-10% signup | Good signal. A/B test headline and CTA for 1 more week. |
| 3-5% signup | Moderate. Rewrite copy based on customer interviews. Test different audience. |
| < 3% signup | Weak. Either the solution doesn't excite people or you're reaching the wrong audience. Consider returning to Pretotyping (2.2) with a different approach. |

## 5. RED FLAGS

- **Founder spends 2 weeks perfecting the design before launching** → "Your landing page doesn't need to be beautiful. It needs to be LIVE. Launch today with good-enough copy. You can always improve it tomorrow."
- **Founder has 0 visits after 1 week** → "The best landing page in the world doesn't work if nobody sees it. Distribution is the bottleneck. Where are you sharing this? Let's make a traffic plan."
- **Founder judges success by compliments, not conversions** → "Your friend said 'nice page!' but they didn't sign up. We measure signups, not compliments. What's your CVR?"
- **Founder wants to add 10 features to the LP** → "A landing page sells ONE thing. One headline. One CTA. One action. Every extra element is a distraction. Simplify."

## 6. EXAMPLES

### Product: Freelancer Task Tool

**Headline:** "Stop losing clients to missed deadlines"
**Subheadline:** "One dashboard for all your freelance projects. Get reminders before things slip."
**CTA:** "Join the Free Beta"
**Traffic:** r/freelance post + 3 Facebook groups + personal LinkedIn
**Result:** 230 visits, 28 signups = **12.2% CVR** → Move to Stage 3

### Service: Restaurant Social Media

**Headline:** "Your restaurant's Instagram — handled"
**Subheadline:** "Daily posts, engagement, and growth. You focus on the food."
**CTA:** "Get a Free Week Trial"
**Traffic:** Local Facebook business groups + Google My Business community
**Result:** 85 visits, 11 signups = **12.9% CVR** → Move to Stage 3 (define service package)
