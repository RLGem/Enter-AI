## 1. CONTEXT

Use this guide when the founder has a working product and needs to improve the user experience. Most solo founders build what makes sense to THEM — but users see it differently. This guide helps the founder run fast, cheap usability tests to find and fix the biggest UX problems. You don't need a UX designer or expensive tools. You need 5 people and 30 minutes. Primary muscle: Reality Testing + Deep Listening. Equipment: Live Demo, Mirror, Data Insights, Form Correction, Progressive Challenge, Rapid Production.

## 2. CORE CONCEPTS

### 2.1 The 5-Second Test

The simplest, fastest usability test. Show your page for 5 seconds, then ask:

```
SETUP:
  1. Show the page (landing page, dashboard, feature) for exactly 5 seconds
  2. Hide it
  3. Ask:
     - "What was this page about?"
     - "What could you do on this page?"
     - "Who is this for?"
     - "What do you remember?"

PASS: 4/5 people correctly identify the purpose
FAIL: 2+ people are confused → Your page isn't clear enough
```

**When to use:** Landing pages, onboarding screens, pricing pages, any page that needs to communicate quickly.

**Tools:** UsabilityHub (free tier), or just screen-share with someone and count to 5.

### 2.2 Think-Aloud Testing

The most powerful usability method for solo founders.

```
SETUP:
  1. Give the user a task (NOT instructions)
     ✅ "Sign up and add your first task"
     ❌ "Click the blue button, then fill in the form"

  2. Ask them to think out loud
     "Tell me what you're thinking as you go"

  3. SHUT UP. Don't help. Don't explain. Just watch and take notes.

  4. Record what happens:
     - Where they hesitated
     - Where they clicked wrong
     - Where they said "I'm confused"
     - Where they got stuck
     - How long each step took

  5. After: Ask "What was the hardest part?"
```

**Sample size:** 5 people find ~80% of usability problems. You don't need 50.

### 2.3 What to Test (Priority Order)

| Priority | What | Why |
|----------|------|-----|
| 1 | **Onboarding flow** | If users can't get started, nothing else matters |
| 2 | **Core action** | The #1 thing your product does — can they do it? |
| 3 | **Pricing/purchase page** | Friction here = lost revenue |
| 4 | **Navigation** | Can they find things? |
| 5 | **Settings/account** | Low priority — test only if users complain |

### 2.4 The Usability Severity Scale

After testing, categorize each issue:

| Severity | Definition | Action | Example |
|----------|-----------|--------|---------|
| **Critical** | User cannot complete the task at all | Fix THIS WEEK | "Sign up" button doesn't work on mobile |
| **Major** | User completes task but with significant difficulty | Fix within 2 weeks | Users can't find how to add a new client |
| **Minor** | User notices problem but works around it | Fix when convenient | "Save" button is below the fold — users scroll to find it |
| **Cosmetic** | Looks wrong but doesn't affect function | Fix if time permits | Font size too small on secondary text |

### 2.5 Common UX Problems and Quick Fixes

| Problem | How Users Show It | Quick Fix |
|---------|-------------------|-----------|
| **Unclear headline** | "I don't know what this does" | Rewrite: lead with the pain, not the feature |
| **Too many options** | Users freeze, click nothing | Reduce to 1-3 choices. Progressive disclosure for the rest. |
| **Hidden CTA** | Users don't know what to do next | Make primary action a large, contrasting button above the fold |
| **Bad onboarding** | Users sign up, do nothing, leave | Add a guided first-run experience: "Step 1 of 3: Add your first task" |
| **Confusing navigation** | Users click wrong tabs, go back and forth | Use clear labels. "Dashboard" not "Home." "Tasks" not "Items." |
| **Form too long** | Users abandon halfway | Ask for minimum info upfront. Collect the rest later. |
| **No feedback** | Users click and nothing happens | Add loading states, success messages, confirmations |
| **Mobile broken** | Users pinch/zoom, buttons too small | Test on real phone. Touch targets: minimum 44×44px |

### 2.6 The DIY Usability Testing Protocol

```
BEFORE THE TEST (15 minutes):
  1. Pick 3 tasks to test (from 2.3 priority list)
  2. Write each task as a scenario:
     "You just signed up for TaskFlow. Add your first client
      and create a task with a deadline for next Friday."
  3. Prepare: screen recording on (Loom free tier) or notes ready

DURING THE TEST (20 minutes per person):
  1. Introduction (2 min): "I'm testing the product, not you.
     There are no wrong answers. Think out loud."
  2. Task 1 (5 min): Give the scenario. Watch. Don't help.
  3. Task 2 (5 min): Same process.
  4. Task 3 (5 min): Same process.
  5. Debrief (3 min): "What was hardest? What was confusing?
     What would you change?"

AFTER THE TEST (30 minutes total):
  1. Review notes from all 5 sessions
  2. Count: how many people hit the same problem?
  3. Rank issues by severity (2.4)
  4. Pick top 3 issues to fix
```

### 2.7 Measuring UX Improvement

| Metric | Before Fix | After Fix | How to Measure |
|--------|-----------|-----------|----------------|
| **Task completion rate** | ___% | ___% | % of users who complete core action |
| **Time to complete** | ___ seconds | ___ seconds | Timer during testing |
| **Error rate** | ___ per task | ___ per task | Count wrong clicks, backtracking |
| **Activation rate** | ___% | ___% | Product analytics (see A.1) |
| **Support tickets** | ___/week | ___/week | Count UX-related support questions |

## 3. DECISION TABLES

### Testing frequency:

| Stage | How Often | What to Test |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| Pre-launch (beta) | After every major change | Core flows |
| Post-launch (0-50 users) | Every 2 weeks | Whatever gets the most support questions |
| Growth (50-200 users) | Monthly | Onboarding + highest-drop-off funnel step |
| Scale (200+ users) | Quarterly + after major releases | New features + regression testing |

### Who to test with:

| Tester | Pros | Cons | When to Use |
|--------|------|------|------------|
| **Friends/family** | Free, available | Too kind, biased | Quick early feedback only |
| **Existing users** | Know the context | Already adapted to problems | Testing new features |
| **Strangers (target audience)** | Most honest | Harder to recruit | Testing onboarding, landing pages |
| **Other founders** | Give detailed feedback | Not your target user | Technical/UX pattern review |

**Best mix:** 2 existing users + 3 strangers from your target audience.

## 5. RED FLAGS

- **Founder never tested with real users** → "You've built this based on what makes sense to YOU. But you already know how it works. Show it to 5 people who don't. You'll be shocked what they can't find."
- **Founder explains the product during the test** → "You just told them 'click the green button.' In real life, you won't be standing behind them. Let them figure it out — that's the test."
- **Founder dismisses user confusion as 'they're not tech-savvy'** → "If 3 out of 5 people can't find the 'add task' button, the button is in the wrong place. Not the users."
- **Founder does a usability test but changes nothing** → "You found 5 issues. You fixed zero. Usability testing without action is just watching people struggle."
- **Founder redesigns everything after one person's feedback** → "One person said the color is ugly. That's an opinion. Three people couldn't complete the signup. That's a pattern. Fix patterns, not opinions."

## 6. EXAMPLES

### Product: Freelancer Task Tool

**5-Second Test:** Showed dashboard for 5 seconds.
- 4/5 said "task management tool" → Pass
- 1 said "calendar app" → Minor confusion from calendar widget

**Think-Aloud Test:** "Add a new client and create a task"
- 3/5 users didn't find the "Add Client" button (hidden in sidebar)
- Critical fix: Moved "Add Client" to main dashboard as prominent button
- Result: Task completion rate went from 60% to 95%

**Before/After:**
- Activation rate (complete first task): 40% → 65% after UX fixes
- Support tickets about "how to add": 8/week → 1/week

### Service: Restaurant Social Media

**5-Second Test on proposal page:**
- 5/5 understood the service → Pass
- But 3/5 didn't see the pricing → Moved pricing section higher

**Client onboarding flow test:**
- Tested the "new client welcome" email + onboarding form
- 2/3 test clients said the form asked too many questions upfront
- Fix: Reduced onboarding form from 15 to 5 questions, collect rest later
- Result: Client onboarding time dropped from 3 days to 1 day
