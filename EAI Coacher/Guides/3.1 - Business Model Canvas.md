## 1. CONTEXT

Use this guide when the founder has paying customers and a working product (Stage 4-5) and needs to see the full picture of their business. The BMC is NOT for beginners — it's dangerous to fill out before you have real customers because it becomes fiction. AIlex introduces BMC here (Stage 5) because now the founder has real data to fill each block. Primary muscle: Wide Vision + Number Reading. Equipment: Live Demo, Mirror, Sharpening Questions, Form Correction, Alternative Planning, Rapid Production.

### 2.2 Filling Each Block (With Real Data)

| Block | What to Write | Common Mistake |
|-------|-------------|----------------|
| **Customer Segments** | Specific persona. "Freelance designers in the US, 1-5 clients, billing $3K-10K/month" | "Everyone" or "small businesses" |
| **Value Proposition** | The ONE thing that makes them choose you. From 3.2. | Listing features instead of outcomes |
| **Channels** | The actual channels driving customers today. From 4.1. | Listing channels you *wish* worked |
| **Customer Relationships** | Self-service? Personal? Community? How do you retain them? | Ignoring this block |
| **Revenue Streams** | Subscription, one-time, usage-based. Actual prices. | Vague "premium plan" without numbers |
| **Key Resources** | Your tech stack, your time, your expertise, your community | Overcomplicating — you're a solo founder |
| **Key Activities** | Product development, customer support, marketing. The 3-5 things you do weekly. | Listing 20 activities (you can't do 20 things) |
| **Key Partners** | Payment processors, hosting, API providers, distribution partners | Listing "dream partners" not real ones |
| **Cost Structure** | Monthly costs: tools, hosting, marketing, your salary draw | Forgetting to include your own compensation |

### 2.3 The Data-Driven BMC

**Rule:** Every block should contain at least ONE number.

```
CUSTOMER SEGMENTS: 52 freelance designers (average billing $6K/month)
VALUE PROPOSITION: Saves 3 hours/week on task management (validated: 8/10 users confirm)
CHANNELS: Reddit (40% of customers), referrals (35%), cold email (25%)
RELATIONSHIPS: Self-service + email support (avg. 2 tickets/customer/month)
REVENUE: $39/month subscription. 52 customers × $39 = $2,028 MRR
RESOURCES: Claude Code, Supabase (free tier), 20 hrs/week founder time
ACTIVITIES: Product dev (10 hrs), support (5 hrs), marketing (5 hrs)
PARTNERS: Stripe (payments), Supabase (backend), Resend (email)
COSTS: $150/month (tools) + $0 (hosting free tier) + $2,000 (founder salary) = $2,150
```

### 2.4 Finding Weaknesses

After filling the BMC, scan for these common problems:

| Weakness | Signal | Fix |
|----------|--------|-----|
| **Single channel dependency** | 80%+ customers from one channel | Add a second channel. See 4.1. |
| **No retention mechanism** | No onboarding, no email, no community | Build one retention loop (email drip, weekly summary, community) |
| **Revenue doesn't cover costs** | Costs > Revenue even at full capacity | Raise prices (4.2) or cut costs |
| **Key person risk** | Everything depends on you | Document processes (5.2), start delegating (5.3) |
| **No moat** | Anyone could copy you tomorrow | Build: data advantage, community, brand, switching costs |

### 2.5 BMC for Service Businesses (🅱️ Track)

| Block | Product Business | Service Business |
|-------|-----------------|------------------|
| Customer Segments | Users of the software | Clients who hire you |
| Value Proposition | What the product does | Your expertise + results |
| Channels | Online marketing, communities | Referrals, LinkedIn, local networking |
| Relationships | Self-service, automated | Personal, high-touch |
| Revenue | Subscriptions, one-time | Retainers, project fees, hourly |
| Resources | Code, servers, APIs | Your time, skills, tools |
| Activities | Build, support, market | Deliver, sell, manage clients |
| Partners | Tech providers | Subcontractors, complementary services |
| Costs | Infrastructure, tools | Your time, tools, subcontractors |

## 3. DECISION TABLES

### BMC health check:

| Question | Healthy Answer | Warning Sign |
|----------|---------------|--------------|
| Can you fill every block with real data? | Yes, using actual numbers | You're guessing on 3+ blocks |
| Is revenue > costs? | Yes, or clear path to it | Revenue < 50% of costs |
| Do you have 2+ channels? | Yes | Single channel = single point of failure |
| Is your value proposition in their words? | Yes (from customer interviews) | It's in your words (feature-speak) |
| Can someone else do your key activities? | At least some of them | Only you can do everything |

### When to redo the BMC:

| Trigger | Action |
|---------|--------|
| Pivot to new audience | Redo Customer Segments, Channels, Value Proposition |
| New pricing model | Redo Revenue Streams, Cost Structure |
| Lost major channel | Redo Channels, find alternatives |
| Quarterly review | Update all blocks with latest data |

## 5. RED FLAGS

- **Founder fills BMC with aspirations, not facts** → "Every block should have a real number. If you write 'influencer partnerships' under Channels but have zero partnerships — that's a wish, not a business model. Fill it with what IS, not what you hope."
- **Founder's Value Proposition is a feature list** → "You wrote '5 features.' Your customers don't care about features. They care about 'saves me 3 hours every week.' Rewrite it in their words."
- **Revenue doesn't cover costs** → "Your BMC shows $2,000/month in costs and $1,200/month in revenue. That's not a business model — it's a countdown to zero. What changes: raise price, cut costs, or get more customers?"
- **Founder skips the BMC** → "You're running a business without a map. The BMC takes 30 minutes to fill out. It will show you exactly where your business is strong and where it's vulnerable."

## 6. EXAMPLES

### Product: Freelancer Task Tool

**Customer Segments:** Freelance designers/developers in US, managing 3-10 clients, billing $50-150/hr
**Value Proposition:** "Never miss a client deadline again — all your tasks in one view with smart reminders"
**Channels:** Reddit r/freelance (40%), referrals (35%), cold email (25%)
**Revenue:** $39/month × 52 customers = $2,028 MRR
**Costs:** $150/month tools + $2,000 founder draw = $2,150/month
**Weakness:** Single founder doing everything → Plan: Hire part-time support (5.3)

### Service: Restaurant Social Media

**Customer Segments:** Independent restaurants in Austin, TX, 1-3 locations, no marketing person
**Value Proposition:** "More customers from social media without you spending time on it"
**Channels:** Local Facebook business groups (50%), referrals from current clients (40%), LinkedIn (10%)
**Revenue:** 5 clients × $800/month average = $4,000 MRR
**Costs:** $50/month tools + $3,000 founder draw = $3,050/month
**Weakness:** Revenue ceiling (solo) at 5-6 clients → Plan: Hire content creator, raise to 10 clients
