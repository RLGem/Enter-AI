## 1. CONTEXT

Use this guide when the founder has a product/service and paying customers but struggles to articulate WHY people choose them. The Value Proposition Canvas connects what the customer needs with what the founder offers. At Stage 5, the founder has real customer data — no more guessing. AIlex helps the founder distill their value into one sentence that drives everything: marketing copy, sales conversations, landing pages, and pitch decks. Primary muscle: Wide Vision + Direct Persuasion. Equipment: Live Demo, Mirror, Sharpening Questions, Form Correction, Rapid Production.

## 2. CORE CONCEPTS

### 2.1 The Value Proposition Canvas

Two sides that must fit together:

```

### 2.2 Jobs To Be Done (JTBD)

Jobs are NOT features. Jobs are what the customer is trying to accomplish in their life.

| Type | Description | Example (Freelancer Task Tool) |
|------|------------|-------------------------------|
| **Functional** | The practical task | "Manage deadlines for multiple clients" |
| **Social** | How they want to be perceived | "Look professional and reliable to clients" |
| **Emotional** | How they want to feel | "Feel in control and not anxious about forgetting things" |

**How to find real jobs:** Go back to your Stage 1-2 customer interviews. Listen for:
- "I need to..."
- "I'm trying to..."
- "Every week I have to..."
- "My biggest challenge is..."

### 2.3 Pains (Ranked by Severity)

| Severity | Description | Example |
|----------|------------|---------|
| **Extreme** | Prevents them from getting the job done at all | "I missed a deadline and lost the client" |
| **Severe** | Makes the job very difficult or risky | "I spend 2 hours every Sunday organizing tasks in spreadsheets" |
| **Moderate** | Annoying but manageable | "I sometimes forget to send invoices on time" |
| **Mild** | Minor inconvenience | "My task list doesn't look pretty" |

**Focus on extreme and severe pains.** Mild pains don't drive purchases.

### 2.4 Gains (Ranked by Relevance)

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|------------|---------|
| **Required** | Must-have, won't buy without it | "I need to see all client deadlines in one place" |
| **Expected** | They assume you offer this | "It should be easy to use and mobile-friendly" |
| **Desired** | They'd love this but don't expect it | "Automatic reminders 24 hours before deadlines" |
| **Unexpected** | They didn't know they wanted it | "Weekly report of completed work to send to clients" |

**Focus on Required and Desired.** Expected gains are table stakes. Unexpected gains create delight.

### 2.5 Crafting The One-Liner

Your value proposition in one sentence. The formula:

```
FORMULA 1 (Pain-focused):
"[Product] helps [customer] stop [pain] by [how]"
→ "TaskFlow helps freelancers stop missing client deadlines
   by putting all tasks in one view with smart reminders."

FORMULA 2 (Outcome-focused):
"[Product]: [Desired outcome] without [biggest pain]"
→ "TaskFlow: Manage all your clients without the spreadsheet chaos."

FORMULA 3 (Before/After):
"Go from [current state] to [desired state] with [product]"
→ "Go from scattered sticky notes to one calm dashboard with TaskFlow."
```

**Test:** Say it to 5 people. If 3+ say "That's exactly what I need," it works.

### 2.6 Fit Analysis

After filling both sides, check the fit:

```
FIT SCORECARD:
For each Pain, rate your Pain Reliever: [0-3]
  0 = Not addressed
  1 = Partially addressed
  2 = Well addressed
  3 = Completely eliminated

For each Gain, rate your Gain Creator: [0-3]
  Same scale

RESULT:
  Average score 2.5+: Strong fit → Your VP is working
  Average score 1.5-2.4: Moderate fit → Improve specific areas
  Average score <1.5: Weak fit → Major VP rework needed
```

### 2.7 VP Evolution

Your value proposition changes as you learn:

| Stage | VP Quality | Source |
|-------|-----------|--------|
| Stage 1 | Hypothesis | "I think they need..." |
| Stage 2 | Tested | "5 people said they'd want..." |
| Stage 3 | Validated | "Beta users are using it for..." |
| Stage 4 | Proven | "Customers are paying because..." |
| Stage 5 | Refined | "Data shows the core value is..." ← YOU ARE HERE |

At Stage 5, your VP should be entirely data-driven, not aspirational.

## 3. DECISION TABLES

### When the VP isn't working:

| Symptom | Diagnosis | Fix |
|---------|----------|-----|
| Landing page CVR < 3% | VP unclear to visitors | Rewrite headline using customer words (from interviews) |
| Customers use it for something you didn't intend | Your perceived VP ≠ real VP | Lean into what they actually use it for. That's your real VP. |
| "Interesting but not for me" | Wrong audience or wrong angle | Check: are you talking to the right customer segment? |
| Customers love it but can't explain it to others | VP too complex | Simplify to one sentence. If they can't repeat it, neither can they refer it. |
| Competitors have same VP | No differentiation | Find your unique angle: speed, niche, experience, integration, price |

### VP by business type:

| Type | VP Focus | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| SaaS (productivity) | Time saved | "Save 3 hours/week on client management" |
| SaaS (analytics) | Insights gained | "See exactly which customers will churn before they do" |
| Service (creative) | Quality + reliability | "Professional social media without hiring a full-time person" |
| Service (consulting) | Results + expertise | "Increase your revenue 30% with a proven system" |
| Marketplace | Access + convenience | "Find and book the best wedding vendors in one place" |

## 5. RED FLAGS

- **Founder describes VP in features** → "You said 'task management with reminders and dashboards.' Your customer says 'I never miss a deadline anymore.' Speak their language, not yours."
- **VP doesn't match what customers actually use** → "Your VP says 'budget tracking.' But 80% of users only use the task checklist. Your real VP is task management. Lean into it."
- **Founder can't say VP in one sentence** → "If you can't explain your value in one sentence, your customers can't explain it to their friends. And word-of-mouth is your cheapest channel."
- **VP is identical to competitor's** → "You and TaskManager Pro both say 'manage your tasks easily.' What makes you different? If the answer is 'nothing' — we need to find or create a differentiator."
- **Founder changes VP every week** → "Your VP has changed 3 times this month. Pick one, test it for 30 days, then decide. Constant changes mean you're guessing instead of testing."
