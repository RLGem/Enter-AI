# 3.3 — PRD & Product Definition

**KB Guide for AIlex | Stage 3: Working Product**
**Version:** 1.0 | **Date:** 2026-02-27
**Word count:** ~2,500 | **Not user-facing — AIlex reference only**

---

## 1. CONTEXT

Use this guide when a founder has proven demand (passed Stage 2) and needs to define exactly what to build. The PRD (Product Requirements Document) is NOT a corporate artifact — for solo founders, it's a 1-page decision tool that separates "must build" from "nice to have." AIlex writes the PRD with the founder, using customer interviews and pretotype data as input. The split between product track (🅰️) and service track (🅱️) starts here. Primary muscle: Minimal Building + Wide Vision. Equipment: Live Demo, Sharpening Questions, Form Correction, Mirror, Rapid Production, Alternative Planning.

## 2. CORE CONCEPTS

### 2.1 The 1-Page PRD for Solo Founders

Forget 20-page corporate PRDs. Solo founders need ONE page:

```
1-PAGE PRD
==========
PRODUCT NAME: _______________
ONE-SENTENCE DESCRIPTION: "It helps [who] do [what] so they can [outcome]"

THE PROBLEM (from Stage 1):
[Problem Statement — copy from validated version]

THE AUDIENCE (from conversations):
[Primary persona — who they are, what they need]

MVP FEATURES (3-5 ONLY):
1. _________ [must-have, solves core pain]
2. _________ [must-have, enables #1]
3. _________ [must-have, minimum user expectation]

NOT NOW LIST (everything else):
- _________
- _________
- _________

SUCCESS METRIC:
"MVP is successful if ___ users [action] within ___ weeks"
```

### 2.2 Feature Prioritization — RICE Framework

Every feature gets a RICE score:

| Factor | Question | Scale |
|--------|---------|-------|
| **R**each | How many users will this affect per month? | Number of users |
| **I**mpact | How much will this move the success metric? | 3=massive, 2=high, 1=medium, 0.5=low, 0.25=minimal |
| **C**onfidence | How sure are we this will work? | 100%=high, 80%=medium, 50%=low |
| **E**ffort | How long to build? (in person-weeks) | Number of weeks |

```
RICE Score = (Reach × Impact × Confidence) ÷ Effort
```

**Example:**
| Feature | R | I | C | E | Score |
|---------|---|---|---|---|-------|
| Checklist | 100 | 3 | 100% | 1 week | 300 |
| Reminders | 80 | 2 | 90% | 1 week | 144 |
| AI Assistant | 50 | 2 | 50% | 4 weeks | 12.5 |
| Vendor Chat | 30 | 1 | 40% | 3 weeks | 4 |

**Cut line:** Top 3-5 features = MVP. Everything else = "Not Now."

### 2.3 MoSCoW Alternative (Simpler)

If RICE feels too complex, use MoSCoW:

| Category | Meaning | Rule |
|----------|---------|------|
| **Must have** | Product doesn't work without this | 2-3 features max |
| **Should have** | Important but can work without | Version 1.1 |
| **Could have** | Nice addition if time permits | Version 2 |
| **Won't have** | Explicitly excluded from this version | The "Not Now" list |

### 2.4 The Product/Service Split (🅰️ vs 🅱️)

| | 🅰️ Product Track | 🅱️ Service Track |
|--|-------------------|-------------------|
| PRD = | Feature list + user stories + tech stack | Service package + process + pricing tiers |
| MVP = | Working software users can interact with | YOU delivering the service to 3-5 clients |
| Success = | Users complete core action independently | Clients are satisfied and would pay to continue |
| Build time = | 1-4 weeks | 1-3 days (you ARE the product) |

### 2.5 User Stories for MVP

Simple format for each feature:

```
As a [user type],
I want to [action],
so that [outcome].

Acceptance criteria:
- [ ] [specific testable condition]
- [ ] [specific testable condition]
```

**Example:**
```
As a freelancer with 5 clients,
I want to see all my deadlines in one view,
so that I never miss a client deliverable.

Acceptance criteria:
- [ ] Dashboard shows all tasks from all projects
- [ ] Tasks are sorted by due date
- [ ] Overdue tasks are highlighted in red
```

## 3. DECISION TABLES

### How many features in MVP:

| Situation | AIlex Guidance |
|-----------|---------------|
| Founder lists 3-5 features | "Perfect. That's an MVP. Let's RICE-score them to confirm priority." |
| Founder lists 10+ features | "That's Version 3, not an MVP. Let's go through each one: which of these did customers actually ASK for in their interviews?" |
| Founder lists only 1 feature | "That might be too minimal. Can a user get value from this single feature alone? If yes — ship it. If not, what's the minimum addition?" |
| Founder can't decide what's MVP | "Go back to your customer conversations. What did they say was the MOST important thing? That's your #1 feature. Build that first." |

### Product vs Service track decision:

| Signal | Track |
|--------|-------|
| Founder has coding skills or AI building experience | 🅰️ Product |
| Founder has no tech skills and service is deliverable manually | 🅱️ Service |
| Solution requires real-time human judgment | 🅱️ Service (at first, automate later) |
| Solution is a tool people use independently | 🅰️ Product |
| Founder wants to test pricing before building | 🅱️ Service (sell first, build later) |

## 5. RED FLAGS

- **Founder building features nobody asked for** → "I see 'mood board generator' on your list. Did any customer mention wanting this? If not, move it to 'Not Now.'"
- **Founder can't say no to features** → "Every feature you add delays launch by days. The goal is: get something in people's hands THIS WEEK. What can you remove?"
- **Founder has been writing the PRD for 2+ weeks** → "The PRD is a decision tool, not a novel. It should take 1-2 sessions. What's blocking the final version?"
- **Service founder overcomplicating their package** → "You're offering 12 things. Your customer wants 3. Which 3 did they actually value in your conversations? That's your package."
