## 1. CONTEXT

Use this guide when the founder has a PRD (3.3) and needs to build and ship their MVP. AIlex helps the founder build fast — not build perfect. The mantra: "If you're not embarrassed by the first version, you launched too late" (Reid Hoffman). The goal is a working thing that 3-5 beta users can use and give feedback on. For 🅱️ service founders, the MVP is THEM — delivering the service manually. Primary muscle: Minimal Building. Equipment: Live Demo, Progressive Challenge, Planned Rest, Form Correction, Rapid Production, Win Celebration.

## 2. CORE CONCEPTS

### 2.1 The MVP Mindset

| Myth | Reality |
|------|---------|
| "MVP means bad quality" | MVP means fewer features, not lower quality. What you ship should work well. |
| "I need all features before launching" | You need 1-3 features that solve the core problem. Everything else is distraction. |
| "Users will judge me for a simple product" | Users judge you for not solving their problem. They don't care how many features you have. |
| "I'll launch when it's ready" | It's never "ready." Launch when it solves the core problem for 3 people. |

### 2.2 Build Timelines by Product Type

| Product Type | MVP Build Time | Tools |
|-------------|---------------|-------|
| Landing page + waitlist | 2-4 hours | Carrd, Framer |
| Simple web app (CRUD) | 1-3 days | Bolt, Lovable, Claude Code |
| Complex web app | 1-2 weeks | Claude Code, Cursor |
| Mobile-first PWA | 1-2 weeks | Claude Code, React |
| API / developer tool | 3-5 days | Claude Code |
| Chrome extension | 2-3 days | Claude Code |
| Spreadsheet product | 2-4 hours | Google Sheets + Apps Script |
| Service package (🅱️) | 1 day | Google Docs for proposal |

### 2.3 The Build Sprint (3-Day Method)

```
DAY 1: SCAFFOLD (4 hours)
  - Set up project with AI tool
  - Build core feature #1
  - Get it "ugly but working"

DAY 2: COMPLETE (4 hours)
  - Build feature #2 and #3
  - Basic styling (doesn't need to be beautiful)
  - Test core user flow end-to-end

DAY 3: SHIP (4 hours)
  - Deploy (Vercel, Netlify, Railway — all free tier)
  - Fix critical bugs only
  - Send to first 3 beta users
  - SET UP FEEDBACK CHANNEL (form, email, chat)
```

**Total: 12 hours across 3 days.** Not 3 weeks. Not 3 months. THREE DAYS.

### 2.4 Beta Testing Protocol

**Who:** 3-5 people from your Stage 1-2 conversations (people who already expressed interest)

**How to invite:**
```
"Hey [name], remember when we talked about [problem]?
I built something that might help. It's early and rough,
but I'd love your honest feedback. Free to use.
Can I send you the link?"
```

**What to track during beta:**
| Metric | How to Measure |
|--------|---------------|
| Did they use it? | Analytics (Mixpanel, Plausible, or just ask) |
| Did they complete the core action? | Funnel tracking or manual check |
| Did they come back? | Return visit within 7 days |
| What feedback did they give? | Feedback form or conversation |
| Would they pay? | Ask directly: "If this cost $X/mo, would you use it?" |

### 2.5 The Feedback Loop

```
SHIP → FEEDBACK → FIX → SHIP → FEEDBACK → FIX
     (3 days)  (1 day)  (1 day)  (1 day)

Sprint 1: Build MVP v1.0 (3 days)
Sprint 2: Fix top 3 issues from beta feedback (1-2 days)
Sprint 3: Add most-requested improvement (1-2 days)
```

**Rule:** Maximum 3 build-feedback cycles before moving to Stage 4 (selling). Don't polish forever.

### 2.6 Service MVP (🅱️ Track)

For service businesses, YOU are the MVP. No software needed.

```
SERVICE MVP CHECKLIST:
[ ] Service package defined (from 3.3)
[ ] Simple proposal/quote template (Google Doc or Canva)
[ ] Onboarding process (3-5 steps to start working with a client)
[ ] Delivery process (how you do the work, step by step)
[ ] Communication channel (email, Slack, WhatsApp — pick ONE)
[ ] Invoice template (Wave, Stripe, or Google Docs)
```

**Deliver to 3 clients for free or discounted.** Their feedback shapes your real service.

## 3. DECISION TABLES

### When founder gets stuck building:

| Problem | AIlex Action |
|---------|-------------|
| "It's not perfect yet" | "Perfect is the enemy of done. Ship it to 3 people. Their feedback will tell you what actually needs fixing — and it won't be what you think." |
| Feature creep (adding features mid-build) | "New feature idea? Add it to the 'Not Now' list. Right now, we're finishing the MVP. You can always add it in v1.1." |
| Technical difficulty | "Is this feature critical for the MVP? If not, cut it. If yes, simplify: can you solve it with a form instead of a database? A spreadsheet instead of a dashboard?" |
| Burn-out during build | "Stop building for today. Come back tomorrow. Forcing code when you're tired creates bugs. The MVP will be better for the rest." |
| "Nobody will want this rough version" | "The people who signed up on your landing page ALREADY want this. They'll forgive rough edges because you're solving their real problem." |

### When to move to Stage 4:

| Signal | Decision |
|--------|----------|
| 3+ beta users actively using the product | Ready for Stage 4 |
| 3+ beta users say "I want to keep using this" | Definitely ready for Stage 4 |
| Beta users using it but requesting major changes | Stay in Stage 3, do one more build cycle |
| Beta users not engaging at all | Problem: either wrong users, broken onboarding, or wrong solution. Investigate before proceeding. |

## 5. RED FLAGS

- **Founder has been building for 3+ weeks without beta users** → "You've been building for 3 weeks. Who has seen it? If the answer is nobody, ship TODAY. Even if it's broken. Feedback from real users is worth more than 3 more weeks of solo building."
- **Founder rebuilding from scratch instead of iterating** → "Rewriting everything is a trap. What specifically is broken? Let's fix THAT, not start over."
- **Founder won't show the MVP because it's 'not ready'** → "I need to be direct: your MVP will never feel ready. That's normal. The question isn't 'is it ready?' but 'can someone use it to solve their problem?' If yes, ship it."
- **All beta users are friends/family** → "Friends are kind. Let's add 2 strangers from your landing page waitlist. Their feedback will be more honest and more useful."

## 6. EXAMPLES

### Product: EventApp (🅰️)

**Build sprint:**
- Day 1: Claude Code scaffolds React app with checklist component + Supabase backend
- Day 2: Add reminders (email via Resend) + budget tracker page + basic auth
- Day 3: Deploy to Vercel. Send to 3 couples from waitlist.
**Feedback:** "Love the checklist! But I need to share it with my partner." → v1.1 adds sharing.
**Decision:** 3/3 couples using weekly → Ready for Stage 4

### Service: Restaurant Social Media (🅱️)

**Service MVP:**
- Day 1: Create proposal template in Google Docs. Define: 12 posts/month, 4 Stories, monthly report.
- Day 2: Offer 3 local restaurants a free 2-week trial.
- Day 3: Start creating and scheduling posts (Canva + Later.com).
**Feedback:** 2/3 restaurants say "When can we sign up for real?" 1/3 says "This is great but I need help with Google reviews too."
**Decision:** 2/3 ready to pay → Move to Stage 4. Add Google reviews to "v1.1" package.
