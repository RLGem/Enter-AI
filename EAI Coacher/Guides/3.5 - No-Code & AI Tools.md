## 1. CONTEXT

Use this guide alongside MVP Development (3.4). This is AIlex's reference for recommending the right tools for each founder's specific needs. The founder doesn't need to learn to code — AI coding tools and no-code platforms have eliminated that barrier. AIlex matches tools to the founder's product type, technical comfort level, and budget. Primary muscle: Minimal Building + Focused Creativity. Equipment: Live Demo, Progressive Challenge, Rapid Production, Form Correction, Alternative Planning.

### 2.2 Tool Selection Decision Tree

```
START: "What are you building?"
  │
  ├─ Landing page / simple site
  │   └─ Carrd (30 min) or Framer (1 hr)
  │
  ├─ Web application (users log in, store data)
  │   ├─ Simple (CRUD, forms, lists)
  │   │   └─ Bolt.new or Lovable (1-2 days)
  │   └─ Complex (custom logic, API integrations)
  │       └─ Claude Code + Supabase (1-2 weeks)
  │
  ├─ Mobile app
  │   ├─ PWA (works on all devices via browser)
  │   │   └─ Claude Code or Bolt (1-2 weeks)
  │   └─ Native (App Store)
  │       └─ Too complex for MVP. Build PWA first.
  │
  ├─ Automation / workflow
  │   └─ Make.com or Zapier (hours)
  │
  ├─ Service business (🅱️)
  │   └─ Google Docs + Canva + Stripe/PayPal
  │       (proposal + branding + payments = 1 day)
  │
  └─ AI-powered tool
      └─ Claude Code + Claude/OpenAI API (3-7 days)
```

### 2.3 The "Good Enough" Principle

| Founder Wants | Spend Time On | DON'T Spend Time On |
|--------------|--------------|---------------------|
| Beautiful design | One clean color palette, readable fonts | Custom animations, pixel-perfect spacing |
| User authentication | Supabase Auth or Clerk (15 min setup) | Building auth from scratch |
| Payments | Stripe Checkout (30 min setup) | Building a payment system |
| Email sending | Resend or EmailJS (15 min) | Running your own email server |
| Analytics | Plausible or Mixpanel free tier | Building a custom dashboard |

**AIlex rule:** Never build what you can buy/use for free. Your time is the scarcest resource.

### 2.4 AI-Assisted Development Workflow

```
STEP 1: Describe what you want (to Claude Code, Bolt, etc.)
  "Build a web app where freelancers can track tasks for multiple clients.
   Include: login, dashboard, add task, set deadline, mark complete."

STEP 2: Review what the AI built
  - Does it work? Test the core flow.
  - Does it solve the problem? Compare to your PRD.

STEP 3: Iterate with specifics
  "Change the dashboard to show tasks grouped by client, not by date.
   Add a red badge for tasks due within 24 hours."

STEP 4: Deploy
  "Deploy this to Vercel" (if using Claude Code)
  Or click "Publish" (if using Bolt/Lovable)

TOTAL TIME: 2-8 hours for a working MVP.
```

## 3. DECISION TABLES

### Tool recommendation by founder profile:

| Profile | Recommended Stack | Why |
|---------|------------------|-----|
| Non-technical, first-time founder | Bolt.new or Lovable + Supabase | Lowest friction, visual, fast |
| Somewhat technical (can read code) | Claude Code + Supabase + Vercel | Most powerful, full control |
| Technical (can code) | Cursor + personal framework + Supabase | Maximum customization |
| Service business (no product needed) | Canva + Google Workspace + Stripe | Tools for packaging, not building |
| Budget: $0/month | Bolt free tier + Supabase free tier + Vercel free tier | Everything on free tiers |

### When founder struggles with a tool:

| Problem | AIlex Response |
|---------|---------------|
| "Bolt generated something broken" | "Try being more specific in your prompt. Or switch to Claude Code for more control." |
| "I don't understand the code" | "You don't need to. Tell the AI what's wrong in plain English. 'The login page shows an error when I click submit.' Let the AI fix it." |
| "The free tier isn't enough" | "At this stage, free tiers should be sufficient. If you're hitting limits, you might be over-building. What can you simplify?" |
| "Should I learn to code?" | "Not now. Focus on building and selling your product. If you need custom features later, you can learn then — or hire someone." |

  Auth: _______________
  Payments: _______________
  Hosting: _______________
  AI tool for building: _______________

MONTHLY COST: $___
BUILD TIME ESTIMATE: ___ days

ALTERNATIVES CONSIDERED:
  _______________ (rejected because: _______________)
  _______________ (rejected because: _______________)
```

## 5. RED FLAGS

- **Founder researching tools for 2+ weeks without building** → "Tool research is procrastination in disguise. Pick one tool. Build something today. You can always switch later."
- **Founder trying to build a native iOS + Android app as MVP** → "Native mobile apps take months. Build a PWA (Progressive Web App) first — it works on all devices and takes days, not months. If people love it, go native later."
- **Founder paying $200+/month on tools before having revenue** → "Your tool spend is too high for pre-revenue. Can we switch to free tiers? You should be at $0-20/month max until you have paying customers."
- **Founder wants to build everything custom** → "Custom = slow. Use Supabase for auth, Stripe for payments, Resend for email. Save your custom building for the thing that makes your product unique."
