## 1. CONTEXT

Use this guide after the founder has initial paying customers from direct sales (4.4). Now they need to expand beyond personal network and reach strangers who have the same problem. The GTM strategy for a solo founder is NOT the same as for a funded startup — no budget means creativity, focus on ONE channel, and relentless testing. AIlex helps the founder identify their single best channel, craft messages, and execute a 30-day launch plan. Primary muscle: Direct Persuasion + Wide Vision. Equipment: Live Demo, Alternative Planning, Sharpening Questions, Rapid Production, Progressive Challenge.

## 2. CORE CONCEPTS

### 2.1 The One-Channel Rule

Funded startups can test 5 channels at once. Solo founders can't. Pick ONE channel and master it before adding another.

**How to pick your one channel:**

| Question | Why It Matters |
|---------|---------------|
| Where do your current customers hang out online? | Go where they already are |
| Where did your best Stage 1-2 conversations come from? | That channel already works |
| What kind of content can you create consistently? | Writing? Video? Speaking? Match your strengths. |
| What's free or near-free? | You have $0 budget. Eliminate paid channels for now. |

### 2.2 Zero-Budget Channel Ranking

| Channel | Time to First Results | Difficulty | Best For |
|---------|----------------------|-----------|----------|
| **Personal outreach** (DM, email) | Days | Easy | B2B, services, high-ticket |
| **Reddit / niche forums** | Days-weeks | Medium | SaaS, tools, technical products |
| **Facebook groups** | Days-weeks | Medium | Local, consumer, communities |
| **LinkedIn** | Weeks | Medium | B2B, professional services |
| **Twitter/X** | Weeks | Medium-Hard | Tech, SaaS, build-in-public |
| **Product Hunt** | 1 day (launch day) | Medium | New products, SaaS, tools |
| **Indie Hackers** | Days | Easy | Bootstrapped products |
| **SEO/Blog** | 3-6 months | Hard | Long-term, evergreen demand |
| **YouTube** | Months | Hard | Complex products, tutorials |
| **TikTok/Reels** | Weeks | Medium | Consumer, visual products |
| **Partnerships** | Weeks-months | Hard | Complementary products |

### 2.3 Crafting Your Core Message

Every GTM message needs three components:

```
1. HOOK: Grab attention with the pain
   "Losing freelance clients because you missed a deadline?"

2. VALUE: Explain what you offer
   "TaskFlow puts all your client work in one view with smart reminders."

3. CTA: Tell them what to do next
   "Try it free for 14 days → [link]"
```

**Message variations for A/B testing:**

| Angle | Example Hook |
|-------|-------------|
| Pain | "Tired of losing track of client deadlines?" |
| Outcome | "Never miss a client deliverable again" |
| Social proof | "127 freelancers already use this to manage their clients" |
| Curiosity | "I built an AI tool that saved me 3 hours every week" |
| Story | "I missed a client deadline and almost lost my biggest account. So I built this." |

### 2.4 The 30-Day Launch Plan

```
WEEK 1 — WARM OUTREACH (personal network + waitlist)
  Day 1-2: Email/DM all waitlist signups (from Stage 2)
  Day 3-5: Personal outreach to 20 people in target audience
  Day 6-7: Follow up with non-responders
  Target: 3-5 new customers

WEEK 2 — COMMUNITY SEEDING
  Day 8-10: Post in 3-5 relevant online communities
  Day 11-12: Engage in comments, answer questions, be helpful
  Day 13-14: Share customer story or result (social proof)
  Target: 50+ new leads/signups

WEEK 3 — CONTENT + OUTREACH
  Day 15-17: Publish 1-2 pieces of content (post, article, thread)
  Day 18-19: Cold outreach to 20 potential customers
  Day 20-21: Ask existing customers for referrals
  Target: 5-10 new customers

WEEK 4 — MEASURE + DECIDE
  Day 22-25: Analyze: what channel converted best?
  Day 26-28: Double down on winning channel
  Day 29-30: Plan next month's GTM based on data
  Target: Clear winning channel identified
```

### 2.5 Community Posting That Doesn't Get Banned

Most communities hate promotional posts. The key: be helpful first, promotional second.

**DO:**
- Share genuine insights, data, or stories
- Answer questions related to your expertise
- Post results ("I built X and here's what happened")
- Give more than you take (10 helpful comments per 1 self-promotional post)

**DON'T:**
- Post "Check out my product!" with a link
- Spam the same message in 10 groups
- Pretend to ask a question that's really an ad
- Ignore community rules

**Template for community posts:**
```
"I've been struggling with [problem] for months.
After talking to [X] people about it, I built [solution].
It does [1-2 things]. Here's what I learned: [insight].

If anyone here has the same problem, happy to share more
or let you try it — [link in comments]."
```

## 3. DECISION TABLES

### Channel selection by business type:

| Business | First Channel | Second Channel |
|----------|-------------|---------------|
| B2C SaaS | Reddit + Product Hunt | Twitter + SEO |
| B2B SaaS | LinkedIn + cold email | Content marketing |
| Local service | Facebook groups + Google Business | Referrals |
| Online service | LinkedIn + community posts | Newsletter |
| Digital product | Twitter + Indie Hackers | Product Hunt |
| E-commerce | Instagram/TikTok + influencers | SEO |

### When things aren't working:

| Problem | Diagnosis | Fix |
|---------|----------|-----|
| Lots of traffic, no signups | Message problem (not product problem) | Rewrite headline to focus on pain, not features |
| No traffic at all | Distribution problem | You're not posting enough or in the wrong places. Where do your customers actually hang out? |
| Signups but no purchases | Pricing or value problem | Add a free trial. Or adjust price. Or improve onboarding. |
| Good response but only from friends | Audience problem | Time to reach strangers. Start cold outreach or community posting. |
| One channel works, others don't | Normal! | Drop the failing channels. Invest all energy in the one that works. |

## 5. RED FLAGS

- **Founder planning GTM for 3 weeks without executing** → "A GTM plan is only as good as its execution. Week 1 starts TODAY. Send 5 messages before our next session."
- **Founder trying 5 channels simultaneously** → "You're spreading too thin. Which ONE channel got the best response so far? Focus everything there for 30 days."
- **Founder spends money on ads before organic works** → "Paid ads amplify what's already working. If your organic message doesn't convert, paid won't either. Fix the message first, then consider ads."
- **Founder posts once and gives up** → "One post is not a strategy. Consistency beats brilliance. Post 3x/week for 4 weeks, THEN judge results."
- **Founder gets banned from a community for self-promotion** → "Communities have rules. The play is: be helpful 9 times, promote once. Let's rebuild your credibility by contributing genuine value."

## 6. EXAMPLES

### Product: Freelancer Task Tool

**Channel:** Reddit (r/freelance, r/digitalnomad)
**Post:** "I'm a freelancer who nearly lost a client because I forgot a deadline. So I built a tool that puts all my client tasks in one view. Here's what it looks like [screenshot]. Free for early users — link in comments."
**Result:** 3,200 views, 180 clicks, 24 signups, 8 free trials, 3 paid.
**Learning:** Pain-focused hook ("nearly lost a client") outperformed feature-focused.

### Service: Restaurant Social Media

**Channel:** Local Facebook business owners group
**Post:** "I run social media for 3 restaurants in [city]. One went from 200 to 500 Instagram followers in 4 weeks and got 8 new customers who mentioned finding them on IG. If any restaurant owners here want help with social, DM me — I have 2 spots open this month."
**Result:** 6 DMs, 4 calls, 2 new clients at $800/month.
