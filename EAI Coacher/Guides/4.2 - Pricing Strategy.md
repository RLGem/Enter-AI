## 1. CONTEXT

Use this guide when a founder has a working MVP (Stage 3) and needs to set a price for the first time. Pricing is the scariest moment for most founders — they'd rather give it away free forever. AIlex's job: make pricing feel rational, not emotional. The core principle is value-based pricing (price based on the value delivered, not cost to produce). Primary muscle: Brave Pricing + Number Reading. Equipment: Mirror, Sharpening Questions, Live Demo, Progressive Challenge, Data Insights, Win Celebration.

## 2. CORE CONCEPTS

### 2.1 Three Pricing Philosophies

| Philosophy | Formula | Best For | Risk |
|-----------|---------|----------|------|
| **Cost-plus** | Cost × markup (e.g., 3x) | Physical products, services with clear time cost | Ignores value; may underprice dramatically |
| **Competitor-based** | Match or undercut competitors | Commoditized markets | Race to bottom; no differentiation |
| **Value-based** ✅ | Price = fraction of value created for customer | Any product/service | Requires understanding customer's world |

**AIlex default: Value-based pricing.** Ask: "How much does this problem cost the customer in time, money, or frustration? Price at 10-20% of that."

### 2.2 The Value-Based Pricing Formula

```
Step 1: Quantify the problem's cost to the customer
  "Freelancers waste 3 hours/week organizing tasks"
  3 hours × $50/hour × 4 weeks = $600/month lost

Step 2: Price at 10-20% of value saved
  10% of $600 = $60/month
  → Price: $39-$59/month (feels like a bargain)

Step 3: Validate with customers
  "If this saved you 3 hours a week, would $39/month be worth it?"
```

### 2.3 The 3-Tier Pricing Model

Most products should have 3 tiers. Psychology: the middle tier looks like the best deal.

```
┌──────────┐  ┌──────────────┐  ┌──────────────┐
│  BASIC   │  │   STANDARD   │  │   PREMIUM    │
│          │  │   ★ POPULAR  │  │              │
│  $19/mo  │  │    $39/mo    │  │    $79/mo    │
│          │  │              │  │              │
│ Core     │  │ Core         │  │ Everything   │
│ features │  │ + key extras │  │ + priority   │
│ only     │  │              │  │ + advanced   │
└──────────┘  └──────────────┘  └──────────────┘
     ↑              ↑                  ↑
   Anchor       Target (70%       Aspiration
   (makes       should pick      (10-15% pick;
   Standard     this one)        high margin)
   look good)
```

**Tier design rules:**
- Basic: Solve the core problem. Nothing extra.
- Standard: Core + 2-3 features that make it significantly better. This is your real product.
- Premium: Standard + features that appeal to power users or businesses. High margin.

### 2.4 Pricing for Services (🅱️ Track)

| Model | Structure | Best For |
|-------|----------|----------|
| **Hourly** | $X per hour | Consulting, coaching (avoid if possible — caps your income) |
| **Project-based** | $X per deliverable | Web design, one-time work |
| **Monthly retainer** ✅ | $X per month for defined scope | Ongoing services (best model for recurring revenue) |
| **Package tiers** | 3 packages at different scopes | When clients have different needs |
| **Value-based** | Price based on outcome, not time | If you can tie to measurable results |

**AIlex recommendation:** Monthly retainer with 3 packages. Predictable revenue for you, clear expectations for the client.

### 2.5 Common Pricing Mistakes

| Mistake | Why It Happens | Fix |
|---------|---------------|-----|
| Pricing too low | Fear of rejection | "If 100% of people say yes to your price, it's too low. You want 60-70% saying yes." |
| Pricing based on competitors | Lazy thinking | "You're not selling the same thing. Your differentiator is worth something. Price for YOUR value." |
| No free tier / free trial | Fear of giving away value | "A free tier proves value and reduces purchase anxiety. It's marketing, not charity." |
| Discounting too quickly | Desperation | "If someone says 'too expensive,' don't discount. Ask: 'What specifically would make this worth the price?'" |
| Only one price point | Simplicity bias | "One price means one-size-fits-all. Three tiers lets customers self-select and increases average revenue." |

### 2.6 Testing Your Price

You don't need 1,000 customers to test pricing. With 10-20 conversations:

```
Method 1: Direct ask
"If this solved [problem], would $39/month be worth it?"
Listen for: immediate "yes" (maybe too low), "let me think" (in the zone), "no way" (too high)

Method 2: Van Westendorp
Ask 4 questions:
1. At what price would this be too expensive?
2. At what price would this be so cheap you'd question the quality?
3. At what price is this starting to get expensive but still worth it?
4. At what price is this a bargain?

Method 3: Real test
Set a price. Put up a payment page. Count who pays.
Change the price after 2 weeks. Compare.
```

## 3. DECISION TABLES

### Price point selection by business type:

| Business | Typical Range | Starting Recommendation |
|----------|-------------|------------------------|
| B2C SaaS (individual users) | $9-49/month | $19-29/month |
| B2B SaaS (small business) | $29-199/month | $39-79/month |
| B2B SaaS (enterprise) | $199-999/month | Start B2C, add B2B later |
| Digital product (one-time) | $19-199 | $29-49 |
| Service (freelance) | $500-5,000/month | $1,000-2,000/month retainer |
| Service (consulting) | $100-500/hour | $150-250/hour or project-based |
| Course / workshop | $49-499 | $99-199 |

### When founder struggles with pricing:

| Signal | AIlex Response |
|--------|---------------|
| "What if nobody pays?" | "Someone already told you they would. Remember [customer quote from interviews]. Start with 1 customer. Just 1." |
| "My competitor charges less" | "Are they profitable? Cheap pricing isn't a strategy — it's a race to the bottom. What do you offer that they don't?" |
| "I feel bad charging people" | "You spent [X] hours building this. It solves a real problem. Charging money is how you keep solving it. Free products die." |
| "Should I start free and charge later?" | "Free tier: yes. Entirely free: no. People who pay are 10x more committed than free users. Free users give you feedback; paying users give you a business." |

## 5. RED FLAGS

- **Founder hasn't talked about price with any customer** → "You've talked to 10 people about the problem but never mentioned money. Price is part of the product. In your next 3 conversations, ask: 'What would you expect to pay for this?'"
- **Founder wants to give it away free 'to build a user base'** → "Free users don't prove a business. They prove a hobby. You need at least 3 people to pay SOMETHING before we move forward."
- **Founder charges $5/month for a product that saves customers $500/month** → "You're leaving massive value on the table. If your product saves $500/month, $5 makes people suspicious, not grateful. Test $39 or $49."
- **Founder changes price 3 times in one week** → "Changing price too often signals uncertainty to customers. Pick a price, test it for 2-3 weeks, then adjust based on data."

## 6. EXAMPLES

### Product: Freelancer Task Tool

**Value calc:** Saves 3 hours/week × $50/hr = $600/month
**Pricing:** Basic $19/mo (1 client), Standard $39/mo (unlimited clients + reminders), Premium $79/mo (+ reports + integrations)
**Validation:** 8/10 freelancers said $39 is "no-brainer"
**Result:** Launched at $39/mo. First 5 customers in 2 weeks.

### Service: Restaurant Social Media

**Value calc:** New customers worth $50-100/visit. 5 new customers/month from social = $250-500/month value
**Pricing:** Basic $500/mo (12 posts), Standard $800/mo (+ Stories + engagement), Premium $1,200/mo (+ paid ads management)
**Validation:** 3/3 restaurants said $500 is "reasonable" for the Basic package
**Result:** 2 signed at Standard ($800), 1 at Basic ($500). MRR: $2,100.
