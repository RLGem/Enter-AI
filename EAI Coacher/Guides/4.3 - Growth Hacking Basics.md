## 1. CONTEXT

Use this guide when the founder has paying customers, a working GTM channel (4.1), and wants to grow faster without spending more money. Growth hacking for solo founders is NOT about "hacks" or tricks — it's about running small, fast experiments to find what scales. AIlex helps the founder build a growth engine: referral loops, viral mechanics, and systematic experimentation. Primary muscle: Direct Persuasion + Focused Creativity. Equipment: Live Demo, Progressive Challenge, Data Insights, Alternative Planning, Sharpening Questions, Rapid Production.

## 2. CORE CONCEPTS

### 2.1 The Growth Equation

```
Growth = Acquisition × Activation × Retention × Referral

If any one of these is zero, growth is zero.
Fix them in this order:
  1. Retention (keep what you have)
  2. Activation (first experience matters)
  3. Acquisition (bring more people)
  4. Referral (let customers bring customers)
```

### 2.2 The Three Growth Engines

Every business runs on one (sometimes two) of these:

| Engine | How It Works | Best For | Example |
|--------|-------------|----------|---------|
| **Sticky** | High retention. Users stay because switching costs are high or product is habit-forming. | SaaS tools, platforms with data lock-in | Notion, Airtable |
| **Viral** | Users bring other users naturally. Built-in sharing or collaboration. | Social products, collaboration tools, marketplaces | Dropbox, Calendly |
| **Paid** | Profitable unit economics allow you to buy customers. LTV > CAC with room to invest. | E-commerce, B2B SaaS with high LTV | Most B2B SaaS |

**For solo founders:** Start with Sticky (retention) + Viral (referrals). Paid comes later when you have proven unit economics.

### 2.3 The Referral Loop

The cheapest way to grow. Design it so sharing is natural, not forced.

```
REFERRAL LOOP STRUCTURE:
  1. TRIGGER: When does the user naturally want to share?
     → After a win (completed project, hit a goal)
     → When collaborating (invite teammate, share report)
     → When impressed (unexpected feature, great result)

  2. INCENTIVE: What do they get for referring?
     → Free month for both (most common for SaaS)
     → Extended trial
     → Premium feature unlock
     → Cash/credit

  3. MECHANISM: How easy is it to share?
     → One-click invite link (best)
     → Email invite from within product
     → Shareable content with branding
     → Referral code

  4. MEASURE: Track the viral coefficient
     → Viral Coefficient = Invites sent × Conversion rate
     → K > 1.0 = viral growth (rare)
     → K = 0.3-0.5 = good organic boost
     → K < 0.1 = referral not working
```

### 2.4 Growth Experiments (ICE Framework)

Don't guess what will work. Run experiments.

```
ICE SCORING:
  I = Impact (1-10): If this works, how much will it move the needle?
  C = Confidence (1-10): How confident am I this will work?
  E = Ease (1-10): How easy is it to test?

  ICE Score = (I + C + E) ÷ 3

  Run the highest-scored experiment first.
```

**Solo founder rule:** Run ONE experiment per week. Not three. One.

| Experiment Type | Example | Time to Test | Typical Impact |
|----------------|---------|-------------|----------------|
| Headline change | A/B test landing page headline | 1-2 weeks | 10-50% CVR change |
| Referral program | Add "invite a friend" with incentive | 1 week setup, 4 weeks data | 10-30% more customers |
| Onboarding email | 3-email welcome sequence | 1 day to set up, 2 weeks data | 20-40% activation boost |
| Pricing page redesign | Move from 2 to 3 tiers | 1 day change, 2 weeks data | 15-30% revenue increase |
| Content experiment | Publish 1 article/week for 4 weeks | 4 weeks | Long-term traffic |
| Partnership | Co-marketing with complementary product | 1 week outreach, 2 weeks test | Variable, 10-100 leads |

### 2.5 Viral Mechanics for Non-Viral Products

Even if your product isn't "naturally viral," you can add viral elements:

| Mechanic | How It Works | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| **Built-in sharing** | Product output is shareable | "Share your report with your client" — client sees your branding |
| **Collaborative features** | Product requires inviting others | "Invite your partner to plan together" |
| **Public profiles/pages** | User-generated content is visible | Portfolio pages, public dashboards |
| **Powered by** badge | Free users show your branding | "Made with [YourProduct]" link |
| **Templates/resources** | Free tools that promote your product | "Free invoice template by [YourProduct]" |
| **Case studies** | Customer stories shared publicly | "How [Customer] saved 10 hours/week with [Product]" |

### 2.6 The Growth Playbook (Weekly Cycle)

```
MONDAY: Review last week's experiment results
  → Did it work? (Define success BEFORE you start)
  → What did we learn?

TUESDAY: Pick this week's experiment (highest ICE score)
  → Write hypothesis: "If we [do X], then [Y] will happen"
  → Define success metric and target

WEDNESDAY-FRIDAY: Execute the experiment
  → Build/launch the test
  → Let it run

SATURDAY-SUNDAY: Let data accumulate (don't touch it)

REPEAT.
```

## 3. DECISION TABLES

### Growth strategy by product stage:

| Customers | Primary Strategy | Experiments to Run |
|-----------|-----------------|-------------------|
| 5-20 | Manual outreach + referrals | Ask every happy customer for 1 referral |
| 20-50 | Referral program + content | Formalize referral incentive, start content |
| 50-200 | Content + partnerships + optimize funnel | A/B test key pages, partner with complementary products |
| 200+ | All channels + paid acquisition | Start testing paid ads with proven message |

### When growth stalls:

| Symptom | Likely Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------------|-----|
| Signups plateau | Channel saturated | Add a new channel (see 4.1) or launch referral program |
| Activation dropping | Onboarding broken or wrong audience | Review onboarding flow. Check if new users match your ideal customer. |
| High churn eating growth | Product or support issue | Fix retention before acquiring more (see R.1) |
| Referrals not happening | No incentive or no trigger | Add a share moment at the user's "aha" moment |
| Content not converting | Wrong content for wrong stage | Write for people who have the problem, not industry news |

## 5. RED FLAGS

- **Founder trying 5 growth experiments at once** → "You're a solo founder. One experiment per week. If you run 5 at once, you can't tell which one worked."
- **Founder focused on acquisition with 40% churn** → "You're filling a leaky bucket. Every 10 customers you bring in, 4 leave. Fix retention first. Then grow."
- **Founder copies competitor's growth strategy** → "Their strategy works for their audience, their product, their budget. What worked for YOUR first 10 customers? Do more of that."
- **Founder expects viral growth from a non-viral product** → "Not every product goes viral. A freelancer task tool doesn't get shared at parties. But referrals? A freelancer tells another freelancer? That's your viral."
- **Founder runs experiment but doesn't measure** → "You launched a referral program 3 weeks ago. How many referrals? If you don't know, you're not running experiments — you're just doing random stuff."

## 6. EXAMPLES

### Product: Freelancer Task Tool

**Growth engine:** Sticky (high retention — task data creates lock-in) + Viral (referral program)
**Referral program:** "Invite a freelancer friend → you both get 1 month free"
- Trigger: After user completes 10 tasks (they're hooked)
- Result: 22% of users shared, 15% conversion → K = 0.33
- Impact: 12 new customers/month from referrals alone (CAC: $0)

**Best experiment:** Added "Weekly Summary" email → Retention increased from 55% to 68%
- ICE: I=8, C=7, E=9 → Score: 8.0
- Hypothesis confirmed: Users who see their progress are more likely to return

### Service: Restaurant Social Media

**Growth engine:** Sticky (results keep clients) + Referral (restaurant owners know each other)
**Referral program:** "Refer a restaurant owner → you get 1 month at 50% off"
- Trigger: After sharing monthly results report (client sees ROI)
- Result: 3 referrals in first month, 2 became clients
- Impact: 40% of new clients now come from referrals

**Best experiment:** Created "Social Media Audit" — free 15-minute review for any restaurant
- ICE: I=7, C=8, E=8 → Score: 7.7
- Result: 8 audits done, 3 became paying clients (37.5% conversion)
