## 1. CONTEXT

Use this guide when the founder has set their pricing (4.2) and needs to make their first sales. For most solo founders, "selling" is the most terrifying word in business. AIlex reframes it: selling is not manipulation — it's helping someone solve a problem they already told you about. The founder already has leads from Stage 1-2 conversations and the landing page waitlist. Now they convert those warm leads into paying customers. Primary muscle: Direct Persuasion + Deep Listening. Equipment: Live Demo, Sharpening Questions, Form Correction, Progressive Challenge, Rapid Production, Win Celebration.

## 2. CORE CONCEPTS

### 2.1 The Solo Founder Sales Mindset

| Fear | Reality |
|------|---------|
| "I'm bothering people" | You're offering a solution to a problem THEY told you about. That's helping, not bothering. |
| "I'm not a salesperson" | Your Stage 1 conversations were sales conversations. You already did this — you just didn't call it "selling." |
| "If the product is good, it sells itself" | Nothing sells itself. Even Apple spends $6B/year on marketing. |
| "I hate being pushy" | Good selling isn't pushy. It's: "You have a problem. I built a solution. Want to try it?" |

### 2.2 The Warm Sales Playbook

Your first customers come from people you already talked to:

```
WARMTH LEVELS (sell in this order):
  🔥 HOT: People who said "tell me when it's ready" (Stage 1-2)
  🟠 WARM: People who signed up on your landing page
  🟡 LUKEWARM: Friends of customers, referrals
  🔵 COLD: Strangers (save for last)
```

### 2.3 The 5-Step Sales Conversation

```
STEP 1: RECONNECT (30 seconds)
"Hey [name], we talked [X weeks ago] about [problem].
 Remember? You mentioned [specific thing they said]."

STEP 2: UPDATE (60 seconds)
"Since then, I built something that solves exactly that.
 [Brief description — 1-2 sentences, not a feature list]"

STEP 3: DEMONSTRATE (2-5 minutes)
Show, don't tell. Screen share, demo, or describe a scenario.
"Here's what it would look like for you: [walk through their use case]"

STEP 4: ASK (1 sentence)
"I'm offering early access at $[price]/month. Would this help you?"
Then STOP TALKING. Let them respond.

STEP 5: HANDLE RESPONSE
  → "Yes!" → "Amazing. I'll send you the payment link right now."
  → "Let me think" → "Of course. What would help you decide?"
  → "Too expensive" → "What would make it worth the price?"
  → "Not right now" → "No problem. When would be better?"
  → "No" → "I appreciate your honesty. Can I ask what didn't fit?"
```

### 2.4 Handling Objections

| Objection | What They Really Mean | Response |
|-----------|----------------------|----------|
| "Too expensive" | Value not clear enough | "I understand. Let me ask: how much time/money does [problem] cost you now? If this saves you [X], would $[price] make sense?" |
| "I need to think about it" | Need more information or reassurance | "Totally fair. What specific questions can I answer to help you decide?" |
| "I'll try it later" | Not urgent enough | "What would need to happen for this to become urgent? Is there a deadline or event coming up where this would help?" |
| "Does it do [feature]?" | Checking if it fits their specific need | Be honest. "Yes, it does" or "Not yet — that's on our roadmap. But the core [X] works great today." |
| "I tried something similar and it didn't work" | Trust issue | "What didn't work about it? [Listen] I built this specifically to avoid that problem. Here's how..." |
| "Can I get a discount?" | Testing your confidence | "The price reflects the value. But I can offer: annual plan at 20% off, or a 7-day free trial to prove it works for you." |

### 2.5 Closing Techniques for Non-Salespeople

| Technique | Script | When to Use |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| **Direct Ask** | "Want to get started?" | When they're clearly interested |
| **Assumptive** | "Should I set up your account now?" | After a positive demo |
| **Trial Close** | "If this solved [specific problem], would it be worth $39/mo?" | When they're hesitating |
| **Urgency** | "I'm onboarding 5 beta customers this week at a launch price" | When they need a nudge |
| **Risk Reversal** | "Try it for 30 days. If it doesn't help, full refund." | When they're risk-averse |

### 2.6 Sales Channels for Solo Founders

| Channel | Conversion Rate | Effort | Best For |
|---------|----------------|--------|----------|
| **1-on-1 conversations** (DM, call, email) | 10-30% | High per sale | First 10 customers |
| **Email to waitlist** | 3-10% | Low per sale | Scaling past personal reach |
| **Social media post** | 1-3% | Medium | Building awareness |
| **Cold outreach** (LinkedIn, email) | 1-5% | High volume needed | B2B, services |
| **Community posts** (Reddit, FB groups) | 1-3% | Medium | Niche products |

**First 5 customers: Always 1-on-1.** Don't try to scale sales before you've done it personally 5 times.

## 3. DECISION TABLES

### Sales approach by business type:

| Type | Primary Channel | Script Focus |
|------|----------------|-------------|
| SaaS / digital product | Email + demo call | Show the product working for their use case |
| Service business | 1-on-1 call or meeting | Focus on their problem, then present your package |
| Digital product (one-time) | Email sequence + LP | Urgency + social proof + guarantee |
| B2B product | LinkedIn + call | ROI calculation + case study |

### When to push vs. back off:

| Signal | Action |
|--------|--------|
| "This is exactly what I need" | Close NOW. Don't add more info. "Great — let me send you the link." |
| Asking detailed questions about features | They're interested. Answer, then close. "Does that answer your question? Ready to try it?" |
| "Sounds interesting" (no energy) | They're being polite. Ask: "Is this something you'd actually use this week?" |
| Not responding to follow-up | Send ONE more follow-up after 5 days. Then stop. Chasing kills relationships. |
| "I need to ask my [partner/boss]" | Offer to talk to them together. "Would it help if I joined a quick call with them?" |

## 5. RED FLAGS

- **Founder has been "preparing to sell" for 2+ weeks without contacting anyone** → "The best sales script is useless until you use it. Call one person today. Just one. We'll debrief after."
- **Founder discounts immediately when someone hesitates** → "You dropped your price before they even objected. That signals you don't believe in your value. Next time, ask WHY they're hesitating before changing the price."
- **Founder only sells to friends** → "Your friends bought because they love you. Strangers buy because they need your product. The first stranger who pays is your real validation."
- **Founder avoids follow-up** → "Following up isn't annoying — it's professional. Most sales happen after the 2nd or 3rd touchpoint. One follow-up at day 3, one at day 7."
- **Founder takes rejection personally** → "A 'no' means 'not right now' or 'not for me.' It's not a judgment of you. The best salespeople get more no's than anyone — because they talk to more people."

## 6. EXAMPLES

### Product: Freelancer Task Tool

**Hot lead:** Sarah from Stage 1 conversations.
**Script:** "Sarah, remember when you told me you nearly lost a client because of a missed deadline? I built TaskFlow — it puts all your client tasks in one view with reminders. Want to see it? [...demo...] I'm offering early access at $39/month. Want to try it?"
**Result:** "Yes! I've been waiting for this." → First paying customer.

### Service: Restaurant Social Media

**Hot lead:** Marco, restaurant owner from beta trial.
**Script:** "Marco, during the free trial your Instagram grew from 200 to 350 followers and 2 customers mentioned finding you on Instagram. The Standard package at $800/month includes everything from the trial plus Stories and engagement. Want to continue?"
**Result:** "Can we start Monday?" → $800 MRR.
