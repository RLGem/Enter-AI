## 1. CONTEXT

Use this guide when the founder has paying customers and needs to answer: "Is my business actually profitable per customer?" Unit Economics is the math that separates a hobby from a business. Most solo founders avoid this because it feels like "boring accounting" — but it's actually the single most powerful lens for decision-making. AIlex makes it simple: three numbers (CAC, LTV, margin) that tell you everything. Primary muscle: Number Reading + Brave Pricing. Equipment: Live Demo, Data Insights, Sharpening Questions, Form Correction, Progressive Challenge, Rapid Production.

## 2. CORE CONCEPTS

### 2.1 The Three Numbers That Matter

```
1. CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost)
   = Total spent getting customers ÷ Number of customers acquired
   Example: $500 on ads + 20 hours × $30/hr value = $1,100 ÷ 10 customers = $110 CAC

2. LTV (Lifetime Value)
   = Average revenue per customer × Average customer lifespan
   Example: $39/mo × 8 months = $312 LTV

3. LTV/CAC Ratio
   = LTV ÷ CAC
   Example: $312 ÷ $110 = 2.8x

   🔴 Below 1x: You LOSE money on every customer
   🟡 1x - 3x: Marginal — need improvement
   🟢 3x - 5x: Healthy business
   🚀 5x+: Very healthy — invest more in acquisition
```

### 2.2 CAC Calculation for Solo Founders

Most solo founders undercount CAC because they forget to include their own time.

```
CAC FORMULA (HONEST VERSION):
  Paid ads:          $___
  + Tool costs:      $___  (email marketing, CRM, etc.)
  + Your time:       ___ hours × $___ /hour (use $30-50)
  + Content creation: ___ hours × $___/hour
  ÷ Customers acquired: ___
  = TRUE CAC:        $___
```

**CAC by channel (typical ranges):**

| Channel | Typical CAC | Notes |
|---------|------------|-------|
| Personal outreach | $5-30 | Your time is the cost |
| Content marketing | $20-80 | Slow but compounds |
| Social media organic | $10-50 | Time-intensive |
| Reddit/communities | $10-40 | Low cost if done right |
| Cold email | $15-60 | Depends on targeting |
| Facebook/Instagram ads | $30-150 | Scalable but expensive |
| Google Ads | $40-200 | High intent but competitive |
| Referrals | $5-20 | Cheapest scalable channel |
| Partnerships | $10-50 | Variable, depends on deal |

### 2.3 LTV Calculation

```
SIMPLE LTV:
  LTV = ARPU × Average Customer Lifespan

  ARPU (Average Revenue Per User per month): $___
  Average Lifespan (months before churn): ___
  LTV = $___ × ___ months = $___

ADVANCED LTV (with churn rate):
  LTV = ARPU ÷ Monthly Churn Rate

  Example: $39/mo ÷ 8% monthly churn = $487.50 LTV

  Monthly churn rate = Customers lost this month ÷ Customers at start of month
  Example: 4 lost ÷ 50 total = 8% monthly churn
```

### 2.4 Gross Margin

Revenue alone doesn't matter — what you keep matters.

```
GROSS MARGIN:
  Revenue per customer:     $___/mo
  - Hosting/infrastructure: $___/mo per customer
  - Payment processing:     $___/mo (typically 2.9% + $0.30)
  - Support time:           $___/mo per customer
  - AI/API costs:           $___/mo per customer
  = Gross Profit:           $___/mo
  = Gross Margin:           ___%

Target: 70%+ for SaaS, 40-60% for services
```

### 2.5 Break-Even Analysis

```
BREAK-EVEN:
  Fixed monthly costs:
    Tools/subscriptions:  $___
    Hosting:              $___
    Your minimum salary:  $___  (what you need to survive)
    Other:                $___
    TOTAL FIXED:          $___/month

  Gross profit per customer: $___/month

  Break-even customers = Fixed Costs ÷ Gross Profit per Customer
  Example: $2,000 ÷ $32 = 63 customers needed
```

### 2.6 The Levers of Profitability

Only 4 ways to improve unit economics:

| Lever | How | Impact |
|-------|-----|--------|
| **Lower CAC** | Better targeting, organic channels, referrals | Direct: lower cost per customer |
| **Raise price** | Increase value, add tiers, annual plans | Direct: higher revenue per customer |
| **Reduce churn** | Better onboarding, more value, community | Higher LTV (customers stay longer) |
| **Reduce costs** | Optimize infrastructure, automate support | Higher margins |

**Priority order:** Reduce churn > Raise price > Lower CAC > Reduce costs

### 2.7 Service Business Unit Economics

```
SERVICE UNIT ECONOMICS:
  Monthly retainer:               $___
  - Hours per client per month:   ___ × $___/hr (your hourly value)
  - Tools per client:             $___
  - Subcontractor cost:           $___
  = Profit per client:            $___/month
  = Margin:                       ___%

  Maximum clients (solo):         ___ (limited by your hours)
  Revenue ceiling (solo):         $___/month

  TO BREAK THE CEILING:
  → Raise prices (deliver more value)
  → Productize (templates, tools, automation)
  → Hire (expand capacity)
```

## 3. DECISION TABLES

### Health check by LTV/CAC ratio:

| LTV/CAC | Status | Action |
|---------|--------|--------|
| < 1.0 | 🔴 Losing money | STOP spending on acquisition. Fix pricing or reduce CAC immediately. |
| 1.0 - 2.0 | 🟡 Barely viable | Not sustainable. Focus on reducing churn and increasing price. |
| 2.0 - 3.0 | 🟡 Okay, needs work | Viable but tight. Pick one lever and improve by 20%. |
| 3.0 - 5.0 | 🟢 Healthy | Good. Start investing more in the channel with lowest CAC. |
| 5.0+ | 🚀 Strong | Excellent. You can afford to invest aggressively in growth. |

### When founder struggles with numbers:

| Problem | AIlex Response |
|---------|---------------|
| "I don't know my churn rate" | "How many customers did you start the month with? How many do you have now? That's your churn. We can calculate it in 2 minutes." |
| "My CAC is too high" | "Which channel has the lowest CAC? Let's put all effort there. Also: are you including your time? If you spend 10 hours getting one customer, that's real cost." |
| "I can't raise prices" | "Can you add more value instead? A feature that costs you $0 but saves the customer $100/month justifies a $20 price increase." |
| "I don't have enough data" | "You have 10 customers. That's enough for basic unit economics. Perfect math comes later — good-enough math guides you now." |

## 5. RED FLAGS

- **Founder has never calculated CAC** → "You're acquiring customers without knowing what it costs. That's like running a restaurant without knowing your food costs. Let's calculate your real CAC right now — it takes 5 minutes."
- **Founder ignores their own time in costs** → "You spent 40 hours this month doing sales and marketing. At $40/hour, that's $1,600 in acquisition cost. Your 'free' marketing isn't free."
- **LTV/CAC is below 1.0 and founder keeps spending on ads** → "Every dollar you spend on ads, you lose money. Stop all paid acquisition today. Fix your retention or pricing first, then restart ads."
- **Founder's only plan to improve is 'get more customers'** → "More customers at a bad unit economics just means losing money faster. Fix the economics per customer first. Then grow."
- **Service founder has no idea about revenue ceiling** → "You work 40 hours/week. Each client takes 10 hours. Your maximum is 4 clients. At $1,000/month each, your ceiling is $4,000/month. Is that enough? If not, you need to raise prices or hire."

## 6. EXAMPLES

### Product: Freelancer Task Tool

**CAC:** $65 (blend of organic content $30 + community posts $40 + referrals $15, weighted by volume)
**ARPU:** $39/month
**Churn:** 12% monthly → Average lifespan: 8.3 months
**LTV:** $39 × 8.3 = $323
**LTV/CAC:** $323 ÷ $65 = 5.0x 🚀
**Gross margin:** 85% (hosting $2, Stripe fees $1.43, AI costs $1.50 = $5.93 COGS on $39)
**Break-even:** $1,500 fixed costs ÷ $33.07 gross profit = 46 customers
**Current:** 52 customers → Profitable!

### Service: Restaurant Social Media

**CAC:** $80 (10 hours prospecting × $50/hr value ÷ 6.25 average closes per batch of prospects)
**Revenue per client:** $800/month (Standard package)
**Hours per client:** 15 hrs/month × $50/hr = $750 cost
**Gross margin:** ($800 - $750) ÷ $800 = 6.25% 🔴
**Problem:** Barely profitable at current hours!
**Fix:** Create Canva templates (reduce to 8 hrs/client) + raise price to $1,000 → New margin: ($1,000 - $400) ÷ $1,000 = 60% 🟢
**Revenue ceiling (solo):** 5 clients × $1,000 = $5,000/month
