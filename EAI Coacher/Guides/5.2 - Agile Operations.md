## 1. CONTEXT

Use this guide when the founder's business is working (paying customers, positive unit economics) and they need to transition from chaos to systems. Solo founders often operate from a to-do list in their head. That works for 5 customers. At 20+, things start falling through the cracks. AIlex introduces lightweight Agile practices — not corporate Scrum, but a solo-founder-friendly system for planning, executing, and improving. Primary muscle: Wide Vision + Leading & Letting Go. Equipment: Live Demo, Sharpening Questions, Form Correction, Alternative Planning, Planned Rest, Rapid Production.

## 2. CORE CONCEPTS

### 2.1 Solo Founder Agile (Not Corporate Scrum)

| Corporate Agile | Solo Founder Agile |
|-----------------|-------------------|
| 2-week sprints with ceremonies | 1-week sprints, 15-min planning |
| Standup meetings | Daily 5-min self-check |
| Sprint review with stakeholders | Weekly review with yourself (or co-founder) |
| Backlog grooming sessions | 15-min weekly backlog cleanup |
| Retrospective with team | 10-min personal retro |
| Jira with 50 columns | Notion/Trello with 3 columns |

### 2.2 The Weekly Sprint

```
WEEKLY SPRINT STRUCTURE:

MONDAY (15 min): PLAN
  1. Review last week: What got done? What didn't?
  2. Pick 5-7 tasks for this week (NOT 15)
  3. Identify the ONE task that matters most
  4. Move tasks to "This Week" column

TUESDAY-FRIDAY: EXECUTE
  Daily 5-min check:
  - What did I do yesterday?
  - What am I doing today?
  - Am I blocked on anything?

FRIDAY (10 min): REVIEW + RETRO
  1. What got done? (celebrate)
  2. What didn't? (why?)
  3. What will I do differently next week?
  4. Update backlog for Monday
```

### 2.3 The Three-Column Board

```
┌──────────────────┬──────────────────┬──────────────────┐
│    BACKLOG       │   IN PROGRESS    │      DONE        │
│                  │                  │                  │
│  All tasks       │  MAX 3 items     │  Completed       │
│  waiting to be   │  at once         │  this week       │
│  done            │                  │                  │
│                  │                  │                  │
│  ☐ Task A        │  ▶ Task D        │  ✅ Task G       │
│  ☐ Task B        │  ▶ Task E        │  ✅ Task H       │
│  ☐ Task C        │  ▶ Task F        │  ✅ Task I       │
│  ☐ ...           │                  │  ✅ ...          │
│                  │  ⚠️ WIP LIMIT: 3 │                  │
└──────────────────┴──────────────────┴──────────────────┘
```

**WIP (Work in Progress) Limit:** Never have more than 3 tasks in progress. Finishing beats starting.

**Tools:** Notion (free), Trello (free), Linear (free for small teams), GitHub Projects (free), or even a Google Sheet.

### 2.4 OKRs for Solo Founders

OKRs (Objectives and Key Results) — simplified for one person:

```
FORMAT:
  Objective: What do I want to achieve? (Qualitative, inspiring)
  KR1: How will I measure it? (Quantitative, specific)
  KR2: How will I measure it?
  KR3: How will I measure it?

EXAMPLE:
  Objective: "Build a sustainable business that supports me full-time"
  KR1: Reach $3,000 MRR by end of Q1
  KR2: Reduce churn to below 8% monthly
  KR3: Launch referral program with K > 0.2

RULES:
  - 1-2 objectives per quarter (not 5)
  - 2-3 KRs per objective (not 7)
  - KRs must be measurable with a number
  - Review weekly, adjust monthly, set quarterly
```

### 2.5 Product Roadmapping

```
ROADMAP LEVELS:

NOW (This Sprint — 1 week):
  Specific tasks. Committed. Will be done.
  Example: "Fix onboarding bug", "Add reminder email"

NEXT (Next 2-4 weeks):
  Planned features. High confidence.
  Example: "Client reporting feature", "Annual billing option"

LATER (1-3 months):
  Ideas and directions. Low commitment.
  Example: "Mobile app", "AI assistant", "Team features"

SOMEDAY (No timeline):
  Wish list. Review quarterly.
  Example: "Marketplace", "White-label", "Enterprise tier"
```

**Rule:** Don't plan more than 1 quarter ahead in detail. The market changes too fast.

### 2.6 SOPs (Standard Operating Procedures)

When you find yourself doing something repeatedly, document it:

```
SOP TEMPLATE:
  Name: _______________
  Trigger: When does this happen?
  Steps:
    1. _______________
    2. _______________
    3. _______________
  Tools needed: _______________
  Time required: ___ minutes
  Can be delegated: [Yes / No / Partially]
  Last updated: _______________
```

**Start with these 5 SOPs:**
1. New customer onboarding
2. Customer support response
3. Weekly metrics review
4. Content publishing
5. Bug fixing process

### 2.7 The Retrospective

The most powerful tool for continuous improvement:

```
WEEKLY RETRO (10 minutes, every Friday):

WHAT WENT WELL?
  • _______________
  • _______________

WHAT DIDN'T GO WELL?
  • _______________
  • _______________

WHAT WILL I CHANGE NEXT WEEK?
  • _______________ (just ONE change)

ENERGY LEVEL (1-10): ___
  If below 5 for 2+ weeks → See Planned Rest.
  Burnout doesn't make better products.
```

## 5. RED FLAGS

- **Founder has no system — everything in their head** → "You dropped a task this week, right? That's your brain telling you it needs a system. 15 minutes to set up a Notion board. Three columns. Done."
- **Founder plans 20 tasks per week** → "You planned 20. Completed 6. That's a 30% success rate — and it makes you feel like you failed. Plan 7 next week. Complete all 7. That's a 100% success rate and it's probably the same 6-7 tasks."
- **Founder skips retrospectives** → "You've been doing the same thing for 3 months without asking 'is this working?' The retro takes 10 minutes. It's the highest-ROI 10 minutes of your week."
- **Founder builds elaborate systems before they need them** → "You have 10 customers and a 12-page project management system. That system is procrastination. Three columns. Five tasks. Go."
- **Founder never finishes anything — always starting new tasks** → "You have 8 things in progress and 0 things done this week. WIP limit: 3. Finish something before starting something new."
