## 1. CONTEXT

Use this guide when the founder has a working business (Stage 5 complete) and has hit their solo capacity ceiling. They can't take on more customers, build more features, or do more marketing without burning out. The founder must shift from "doing everything" to "leading others." This is the hardest transition in entrepreneurship — letting go of control. AIlex helps the founder identify their first hire, write job descriptions, and build a delegation framework. Primary muscle: Leading & Letting Go + Deep Listening. Equipment: Sharpening Questions, Mirror, Live Demo, Alternative Planning, Progressive Challenge, Planned Rest.

## 2. CORE CONCEPTS

### 2.1 The Solo Founder Capacity Ceiling

```
SIGNS YOU'VE HIT THE CEILING:
  ☐ Working 50+ hours/week consistently
  ☐ Turning away customers because you have no capacity
  ☐ Quality dropping because you're stretched thin
  ☐ No time for product development (only firefighting)
  ☐ Responding to support tickets at 11pm
  ☐ Haven't taken a day off in 4+ weeks
  ☐ Revenue is flat because YOU are the bottleneck

If 3+ are checked: It's time to hire.
```

### 2.2 What to Delegate First

```
THE DELEGATION MATRIX:
                          Low Skill Required    High Skill Required
                         ┌────────────────────┬────────────────────┐
  You Don't Enjoy It     │  DELEGATE FIRST    │  DELEGATE SECOND   │
                         │  (Hire/automate)   │  (Find a specialist)│
                         │  • Data entry      │  • Bookkeeping     │
                         │  • Scheduling      │  • Graphic design  │
                         │  • Basic support   │  • Code bugs       │
                         ├────────────────────┼────────────────────┤
  You Enjoy It           │  AUTOMATE          │  KEEP (for now)    │
                         │  (Use tools/AI)    │  (Your core value) │
                         │  • Social posting  │  • Product strategy│
                         │  • Invoice sending │  • Key sales calls │
                         │  • Email sequences │  • Customer insight│
                         └────────────────────┴────────────────────┘
```

**Rule:** Delegate what you're bad at or what drains you. Keep what only you can do (strategy, key relationships, product vision).

### 2.3 First Hire Options

| Option | Cost | Commitment | Best For |
|--------|------|-----------|----------|
| **Virtual Assistant (VA)** | $5-25/hr | Part-time, flexible | Admin, scheduling, data entry, basic support |
| **Freelancer (project-based)** | $20-150/hr | Per project | Design, development, writing, specialized skills |
| **Part-time contractor** | $15-60/hr | 10-20 hrs/week | Ongoing tasks like content creation, support |
| **Co-founder** | Equity (no salary) | Full commitment | When you need a true partner with complementary skills |
| **Intern** | $0-15/hr | 10-20 hrs/week | Simple tasks, extra hands, potential future hire |
| **Full-time employee** | $3K-8K+/month | High commitment | Only when revenue supports it comfortably |

**AIlex recommendation for first hire:** Start with a part-time freelancer or VA. Test for 30 days before committing.

### 2.4 The First Hire Playbook

```
STEP 1: IDENTIFY THE ROLE (1 day)
  What tasks will this person do? (list 5-10 tasks)
  How many hours per week? ___
  What skills do they need?
  What's the budget? $___/month

STEP 2: WRITE THE JOB DESCRIPTION (1 hour)
  Title: ___
  Responsibilities (5-7 bullet points)
  Requirements (must-have skills)
  Nice-to-haves
  Hours and pay
  How to apply (simple: email with 2-3 questions)

STEP 3: FIND CANDIDATES (1 week)
  Where to post:
  • Upwork / Fiverr (freelancers)
  • LinkedIn (professionals)
  • Indeed / Remote.co (part/full-time)
  • Twitter/X (niche communities)
  • Your network (often the best source)

STEP 4: SCREEN (3-5 candidates, 15 min each)
  Questions:
  1. "Tell me about similar work you've done"
  2. "Here's a scenario: [real task]. How would you approach it?"
  3. "What's your availability and rate?"

STEP 5: TRIAL (1-2 weeks)
  Give a real (paid) task. Evaluate:
  • Quality of work
  • Communication
  • Speed
  • Do they ask good questions?

STEP 6: DECIDE
  If good → Ongoing engagement with clear scope
  If not → Thank them, pay for trial work, try someone else
```

### 2.5 Delegation Without Losing Quality

| Fear | Solution |
|------|---------|
| "They won't do it as well as me" | Define "good enough" — 80% of your quality is fine for most tasks |
| "It takes longer to explain than to do it myself" | True the first time. By the 5th time, you've saved 20+ hours |
| "What if they make a mistake?" | Create SOPs (5.2) and review their work for the first 2 weeks |
| "I can't afford to hire" | Start with 5 hours/week. At $20/hr, that's $400/month. If it frees you to make 1 more sale, it pays for itself |
| "I'll lose control" | Weekly 15-minute check-ins. Clear expectations. You're still in charge |

### 2.6 The 80% Rule

> "If someone can do the task 80% as well as you, delegate it."

You don't need perfection for:
- Customer support responses
- Social media posts
- Data entry and reporting
- Scheduling and calendar management
- First-draft content
- Basic design work

You DO need perfection (or near it) for:
- Product decisions
- Key customer relationships
- Pricing strategy
- Hiring decisions
- Financial management

### 2.7 Managing Your First Hire

```
WEEKLY MANAGEMENT RHYTHM:
  Monday: Share priorities for the week (5 min async message)
  Wednesday: Quick check-in — any blockers? (5 min)
  Friday: Review completed work, give feedback (15 min)

COMMUNICATION:
  Tool: Slack, WhatsApp, or email (pick ONE)
  Response time expectation: Within ___ hours
  Meeting cadence: 1x/week (15-30 min max)

FEEDBACK:
  Be specific: "The blog post was good. The headline could be stronger
  — try leading with the customer pain, not the feature."
  Not: "It was okay, I guess."
```

## 5. RED FLAGS

- **Founder does everything solo despite hitting revenue ceiling** → "Your revenue has been flat for 2 months. Not because demand is low — because YOU are maxed out. Hiring someone for $400/month could unlock $2,000/month in new capacity."
- **Founder hires full-time too early** → "You have $3,000 MRR and want to hire a full-time developer at $5,000/month. That's a death wish. Start with a part-time freelancer at $1,000/month. Scale up when revenue supports it."
- **Founder can't delegate because 'nobody can do it like me'** → "You're right — nobody will do it exactly like you. But 80% as good, at 20% of the time cost, is a great deal. Your time is better spent on strategy and sales."
- **Founder micromanages first hire** → "You hired someone to free up your time, then spent the same amount of time checking their work. Give clear instructions, review once, give feedback. Trust builds over time."
- **Founder delegates core decisions** → "You hired a VA and asked them to set your pricing. Pricing is a founder decision. Delegate tasks, not strategy."

## 6. EXAMPLES

### Product: Freelancer Task Tool

**Ceiling hit:** 52 customers, spending 8 hrs/week on support, 0 time for product development.
**First hire:** Part-time customer support person (Upwork, $20/hr, 10 hrs/week = $800/month)
**Tasks delegated:** Email support, onboarding calls, FAQ updates
**Result:** Founder freed 8 hours/week → Built 2 new features → Added 15 customers next month
**ROI:** $800/month cost → $585/month new revenue (15 × $39) = Paid for itself in 6 weeks

### Service: Restaurant Social Media

**Ceiling hit:** 5 clients at 15 hrs each = 75 hrs/month. No room for client #6.
**First hire:** Part-time content creator (local college student, $15/hr, 20 hrs/month = $300/month)
**Tasks delegated:** Creating social media graphics and scheduling posts
**Result:** Founder's per-client time dropped from 15 to 8 hrs → Took on 3 more clients
**ROI:** $300/month cost → $2,400/month new revenue (3 × $800) = 8x return
