## 1. CONTEXT

Use this guide when the founder's business is growing and they're considering raising money — or wondering if they should. Most solo founders DON'T need to raise money. AIlex's first job is to help the founder decide: bootstrap or raise? If raising makes sense, AIlex helps them prepare a pitch deck, understand deal structures, and find the right investors. If bootstrapping is better, AIlex validates that decision and shows them how to grow with revenue. Primary muscle: Direct Persuasion + Number Reading. Equipment: Live Demo, Sharpening Questions, Data Insights, Form Correction, Progressive Challenge, Rapid Production.

## 2. CORE CONCEPTS

### 2.1 Bootstrap vs. Raise — The Decision

| Factor | Bootstrap | Raise |
|--------|----------|-------|
| **Ownership** | You keep 100% | You give up 10-25% per round |
| **Speed** | Grow at revenue pace | Grow faster with cash injection |
| **Pressure** | Pressure to be profitable | Pressure to grow fast (investors expect returns) |
| **Focus** | Build for customers | Build for customers AND investors |
| **Exit requirement** | No obligation to exit | Investors expect a return (usually exit or IPO) |
| **Decision freedom** | You decide everything | Board/investors have input |
| **Risk** | Your money, your risk | Shared risk with investors |

**AIlex default position: Bootstrap first.** Raise only if ALL of these are true:
1. You have proven product-market fit (Stage 5 complete)
2. Growth is limited by capital, not by demand
3. The market opportunity is large enough to justify investor returns
4. You understand what you're giving up

### 2.2 Funding Options for Solo Founders

| Source | Amount | What You Give Up | Best For |
|--------|--------|-----------------|----------|
| **Bootstrapping** | $0 (revenue-funded) | Nothing | Profitable businesses, lifestyle businesses |
| **Friends & Family** | $5K-50K | Relationship risk | Very early stage, trusted people only |
| **Revenue-Based Financing** | $10K-500K | % of revenue until repaid | Growing businesses with consistent revenue |
| **Small Business Grants** | $1K-50K | Nothing (free money) | Specific demographics/industries |
| **SBA Loans** | $5K-5M | Interest + collateral | Established businesses with revenue history |
| **Angel Investors** | $25K-500K | 5-20% equity | Pre-seed/Seed with PMF |
| **SAFE notes** | $50K-2M | Equity on future terms | Startup-style raise from angels |
| **Accelerators** | $25K-500K + mentorship | 5-10% equity | Early-stage startups wanting structure |
| **Venture Capital** | $500K-10M+ | 15-30% equity + board seat | High-growth startups targeting large markets |
| **Crowdfunding** | $5K-1M+ | Depends on structure | Consumer products with existing audience |

### 2.3 The Pitch Deck (10 Slides)

```
SLIDE 1: TITLE
  Company name + one-liner value proposition + your name

SLIDE 2: PROBLEM
  What pain are you solving? Use a story or data point.
  "250,000 freelancers lose clients every year due to missed deadlines."

SLIDE 3: SOLUTION
  What you built. Screenshot or demo.
  "TaskFlow puts all client tasks in one view with smart reminders."

SLIDE 4: TRACTION
  Your numbers. This is the most important slide.
  "52 paying customers. $2,028 MRR. Growing 15% month-over-month."

SLIDE 5: MARKET
  TAM → SAM → SOM. How big is the opportunity?
  "59M freelancers in the US. Our target: 500K who manage 3+ clients."

SLIDE 6: BUSINESS MODEL
  How you make money. Pricing, LTV, CAC, margins.
  "$39/month subscription. LTV: $323. CAC: $65. LTV/CAC: 5.0x."

SLIDE 7: COMPETITION
  Feature comparison matrix. What makes you different?
  Position yourself — don't badmouth competitors.

SLIDE 8: TEAM
  Who you are. Why you? What's your unfair advantage?
  Solo founders: emphasize domain expertise + customer obsession.

SLIDE 9: ROADMAP
  What you'll build with the money. Next 12-18 months.
  "Q1: Team feature. Q2: Mobile app. Q3: Enterprise tier."

SLIDE 10: THE ASK
  How much are you raising? What will you use it for?
  "Raising $150K to hire a developer and scale marketing."
```

### 2.4 The Elevator Pitch (30 Seconds)

```
FORMULA:
"[TARGET CUSTOMER] struggle with [PROBLEM].
[PRODUCT NAME] is a [CATEGORY] that [VALUE PROPOSITION].
We have [TRACTION] and we're raising [AMOUNT] to [GOAL]."

EXAMPLE:
"Freelancers managing multiple clients struggle with missed deadlines
and scattered tasks. TaskFlow is a task management tool that puts all
client work in one view with smart reminders. We have 52 paying
customers at $39/month — growing 15% monthly — and we're raising
$150K to build team features and scale marketing."
```

### 2.5 SAFE Notes (Simple Agreement for Future Equity)

The most common instrument for early-stage raises:

```
KEY TERMS:
  Valuation Cap: Maximum valuation at which investor's money converts to equity
    Example: $1M cap → If you later raise at $5M valuation,
    the investor's shares price at $1M (5x better deal)

  Discount: Percentage discount on the next round's price
    Example: 20% discount → If next round prices at $1/share,
    SAFE investor gets shares at $0.80/share

  Pro Rata Rights: Right to invest in future rounds to maintain % ownership

WHAT TO NEGOTIATE:
  → Valuation cap (lower = more dilution for you)
  → Discount rate (standard: 15-25%)
  → Whether MFN (Most Favored Nation) clause applies
```

### 2.6 Grants and Non-Dilutive Funding

Free money exists — but it takes effort to find and apply:

| Source | Who Qualifies | Amount | Where to Find |
|--------|-------------|--------|---------------|
| **SBIR/STTR** | US tech companies | $50K-$2M | sbir.gov |
| **State grants** | Varies by state | $5K-100K | Your state's economic development office |
| **Minority/Women founder grants** | Underrepresented founders | $5K-50K | Grants.gov, Hello Alice |
| **Industry-specific** | Health, education, clean energy, etc. | $10K-500K | Sector-specific organizations |
| **Accelerator grants** | Accepted startups | $10K-150K | Y Combinator, Techstars, etc. |
| **Competitions** | Anyone who enters | $1K-50K | University competitions, startup events |

## 3. DECISION TABLES

### Should you raise money?

| Question | If Yes | If No |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Are you profitable? | Bootstrap may be better | Raising may be necessary |
| Is demand outpacing your capacity? | Raising could accelerate growth | Keep bootstrapping |
| Is the market winner-take-all? | Speed matters — consider raising | Niche = bootstrap works fine |
| Are you comfortable giving up equity? | Raising is an option | Bootstrap |
| Can you grow 3x/year with revenue alone? | Bootstrap | Raising may be needed for competitive pace |
| Do you want to build a billion-dollar company? | Raise (eventually) | Bootstrap (lifestyle business is great) |

### Common investor questions (prepare answers):

| Question | What They're Really Asking |
|----------|---------------------------|
| "What's your moat?" | Why can't someone copy you and take your customers? |
| "How do you acquire customers?" | Is your growth scalable or does it depend on you personally? |
| "What keeps you up at night?" | Are you self-aware about risks? |
| "Why now?" | Is there a market timing advantage? |
| "What will you do with the money?" | Do you have a clear plan, or are you raising just because? |
| "What if a competitor raises $10M?" | Are you defensible? |

## 5. RED FLAGS

- **Founder wants to raise money at Stage 1-2** → "You don't have paying customers yet. Investors want traction, not ideas. Get to $1K MRR first, then we'll talk about raising."
- **Founder raises money to avoid selling** → "Raising isn't an alternative to selling. Investors give you money to sell MORE, not to avoid selling. If you can't sell to customers, you can't sell to investors either."
- **Founder gives away 40%+ equity in first round** → "You're giving away nearly half your company before you've proven the business model. Standard seed rounds are 10-20%. Negotiate harder or raise less."
- **Founder raising without knowing what the money is for** → "How much do you need and what exactly will you spend it on? 'We need $500K for growth' isn't a plan. '$150K: $80K for developer, $50K for marketing, $20K for runway' is a plan."
- **Founder compares themselves to VC-funded startups** → "That competitor raised $5M. You haven't. Stop comparing. Your advantage is speed, focus, and proximity to customers. They have meetings; you have customers."

## 6. EXAMPLES

### Product: Freelancer Task Tool

**Decision:** Bootstrap
**Rationale:** $2,028 MRR, growing 15%/month, LTV/CAC 5.0x. The business is profitable and growing. Raising money would mean giving up equity for growth that's already happening organically.
**Alternative:** Applied for 2 grants ($10K each) for marketing experiments. No equity diluted.
**12-month projection:** At 15% monthly growth → ~$7,500 MRR → $90K ARR

### Service: Restaurant Social Media

**Decision:** Bootstrap (with small business loan consideration)
**Rationale:** $4,000 MRR with 60% margins. Revenue-funded growth is working. Considered a small SBA microloan ($10K) to hire a content creator and scale to 10 clients.
**Alternative:** Won a $5,000 small business grant from local chamber of commerce.
**12-month projection:** 10 clients × $900 average = $9,000 MRR → $108K ARR
