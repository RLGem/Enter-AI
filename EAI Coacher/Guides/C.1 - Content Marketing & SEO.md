## 1. CONTEXT (When does AIlex use this guide?)

Use this guide when a founder has paying customers, validated PMF, and needs a sustainable, free acquisition channel. Content marketing is the #1 free growth strategy for bootstrapped founders — but only if done with distribution-first thinking. Most founders create content nobody sees. AIlex teaches the opposite: find where the audience already is, then create content that meets them there. This guide loads alongside 4.3 (Growth Hacking) and 3.2 (Value Proposition Design) in Stage 5.

---

## 2. CORE CONCEPTS

### 2.1 Distribution-First Content Strategy

Most founders think: Create content → Hope people find it.
The right way: Find where people already are → Create content for that channel.

```
❌ WRONG ORDER:
Write blog post → Share on social → Hope for traffic → Nothing happens

✅ RIGHT ORDER:
Identify: "My audience hangs out on r/freelance" →
Study: "Top posts are 'how I landed my first client' stories" →
Create: Post your story with real numbers →
Convert: "I built a tool that automates this. Link in comments."
```

**The Distribution Matrix:**

| Channel | Effort | Time to Results | Best For | Content Format |
|---------|--------|----------------|----------|---------------|
| **Reddit** | Low | Days | SaaS, tools, niche products | Honest stories, data, AMA-style posts |
| **Twitter/X** | Medium | Weeks | Tech, SaaS, personal brand | Threads, hot takes, build-in-public updates |
| **LinkedIn** | Medium | Weeks | B2B, services, consulting | Personal stories with business lessons |
| **YouTube** | High | Months | Tutorials, complex products | How-to videos, behind-the-scenes |
| **Newsletter** | Medium | Months | Any | Curated insights, exclusive content |
| **SEO/Blog** | High | 3-6 months | Evergreen search demand | How-to guides, comparison posts, listicles |
| **Product Hunt** | Low (one-time) | Days | New products, SaaS | Launch page + story |
| **Indie Hackers** | Low | Days | Bootstrapped products | Revenue updates, lessons learned |
| **TikTok/Reels** | Medium | Weeks | Consumer, visual products | Quick tips, demos, before/after |

**AIlex default recommendation for Stage 5 founder:**
1. Pick ONE channel where your customers already hang out
2. Post consistently for 30 days
3. Measure: traffic, signups, or conversations generated
4. Double down or switch

### 2.2 Building in Public

The most powerful free marketing strategy for solo founders. Share your journey openly:

**What to share:**
- Revenue milestones: "Just hit $1K MRR — here's how"
- Failures: "Lost 3 customers this month. Here's what I learned"
- Behind the scenes: "Here's my actual dashboard/revenue/tech stack"
- Decisions: "Choosing between X and Y. Here's my thinking..."
- Customer wins: "A customer just told me [amazing thing]. This is why I do this."

**Where to build in public:**
- Twitter/X — use hashtag #buildinpublic
- Indie Hackers — post milestones and revenue updates
- Reddit — share in relevant subreddits (NOT as spam)
- Personal blog/newsletter — own your audience

**Rules of building in public:**
1. Be specific. "$2,341 MRR" beats "growing revenue."
2. Be honest. Share failures, not just wins.
3. Be helpful. Every post should teach something, not just brag.
4. Be consistent. 3x/week minimum.
5. Don't sell in every post. 80% value, 20% promotion.

### 2.3 SEO for Bootstrapped Founders

SEO is a long game (3-6 months to see results) but the most sustainable free traffic source. For solo founders, focus on low-competition, high-intent keywords.

**The SEO Pyramid:**

```
         ┌───────────────┐
         │  Money Pages   │  ← Your product/pricing pages
         │  (convert)     │     Optimize for buying intent
         ├───────────────┤
         │  Comparison    │  ← "[Your product] vs [Competitor]"
         │  Pages         │     "[Category] alternatives"
         ├───────────────┤
         │  How-To        │  ← "How to [problem you solve]"
         │  Content       │     Long-tail, low competition
         ├───────────────┤
         │  Thought       │  ← Industry insights, opinions
         │  Leadership    │     Builds authority, earns backlinks
         └───────────────┘
```

**Keyword Research (Free Tools):**
- **Google Autocomplete** — Type your topic, see what people search
- **AnswerThePublic** — Questions people ask about your topic
- **Google Search Console** — What queries bring people to your site now
- **Ahrefs Free Tools** — Basic keyword difficulty and volume

**The Solo Founder SEO Strategy:**
1. Find 10 long-tail keywords related to the problem you solve
2. Write 10 blog posts (1,500-2,500 words each), one per keyword
3. Optimize basics: title tag, meta description, H1/H2 headers, internal links
4. Publish 1 post/week for 10 weeks
5. After 3 months: check Google Search Console for which posts rank
6. Double down on winners (update, add content, build internal links)

**Content Template for SEO Posts:**

```
TITLE: How to [achieve outcome] — [specific method or year]
  Example: "How to Get Your First 10 Customers with Zero Ad Budget"

STRUCTURE:
1. Hook: Start with a relatable problem (50 words)
2. Promise: What the reader will learn (1 sentence)
3. Method: Step-by-step guide (the meat — 1,000+ words)
4. Examples: 1-2 real examples with numbers
5. CTA: "I built [product] to solve this. Try it free."
```

### 2.4 Newsletter Strategy

Owning your audience is critical. Social platforms change algorithms; email lists are yours forever.

**Newsletter Stack for Solo Founders:**
- **Beehiiv** — Free up to 2,500 subscribers, monetization built in
- **ConvertKit** — Free up to 10,000 subscribers, good automation
- **Substack** — Free, built-in discovery, but you don't own the platform

**Growth Tactics:**
- Add email capture to every blog post (exit intent popup, in-content CTA)
- Offer a "lead magnet" — free resource in exchange for email (template, checklist, guide)
- Cross-promote: mention newsletter in social posts, vice versa
- Make the first email incredibly valuable (not a sales pitch)

**Newsletter Content Formula (weekly):**
1. One insight from your business journey (build in public)
2. One tactical tip the reader can use today
3. One resource or tool recommendation
4. Soft CTA: "This is exactly what [product] helps with"

### 2.5 Content Metrics That Matter

| Metric | What It Tells You | Target (Stage 5) |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Traffic** | How many people see your content | Trending up month-over-month |
| **Email signups** | How many people want more | 2-5% of blog visitors |
| **Signup-to-trial** | Content attracts the right audience | 10-20% of email list |
| **Content → Customer** | Content drives revenue | Track with UTM parameters |
| **Time on page** | Content is engaging | > 3 minutes for blog posts |

**Metrics that DON'T matter (yet):**
- Social media followers (vanity metric)
- Blog post count (quality > quantity)
- Domain Authority (takes years, not a Stage 5 priority)

---

## 3. DECISION TABLES

### Which content channel to start with:

| Business Type | Primary Channel | Why | Secondary |
|---------------|----------------|-----|-----------|
| SaaS product | SEO + Twitter/X | Search intent = buyers; Twitter = tech community | Product Hunt, Indie Hackers |
| Service business | LinkedIn + Newsletter | Professional network = clients | Blog for SEO |
| Consumer product | TikTok/Reels + Instagram | Visual, impulse-driven | YouTube for tutorials |
| Developer tool | Dev.to + Reddit + GitHub | Developers hate marketing but love useful tools | Twitter/X |
| Local business | Google Business Profile + Local SEO | "near me" searches | Facebook groups |
| B2B product | LinkedIn + Cold email + SEO | Decision-makers live on LinkedIn | Case studies on blog |

### When AIlex triggers content strategy conversation:

| Trigger | AIlex Action |
|---------|-------------|
| Founder asks "how do I get more customers?" | "Let's figure out where your customers already hang out online. Where did your current customers find you?" |
| Founder wants to spend on ads | "Ads work — but let's make sure your organic engine is running first. Paid amplifies what already works. What content have you posted this month?" |
| Founder has customers but no content presence | "You have 15 happy customers and zero online presence. That's a missed opportunity. Every customer story is a piece of content. Let's turn your best customer win into a post this week." |
| Founder is posting but getting no traction | "Let's audit: where are you posting, what's the format, and what's the engagement? Often it's a distribution problem, not a content problem." |

## 5. RED FLAGS

- **Founder is posting on 5 channels simultaneously** → "Stop. You're spreading too thin. Pick ONE channel, post 3x/week for 30 days, measure, then decide. One channel done well beats five done poorly."
- **Founder has been blogging for 2 months with zero traffic** → "SEO takes 3-6 months. But let's check: are you targeting the right keywords? Let's audit your posts against what people actually search for."
- **Founder is creating content but not measuring anything** → "Content without measurement is just journaling. Set up Google Analytics and UTM links. We need to know: what content drives signups?"
- **Founder is buying followers/engagement** → "Don't. Fake followers don't buy products. Focus on 100 real people who care about your content over 10,000 bots."
- **Founder spends all their time on content, not product** → "Content is a growth tool, not the product. Your customers are paying for [product], not your Twitter feed. Let's cap content creation at 5 hours/week and protect your product time."
