## 1. CONTEXT (When does AIlex use this guide?)

Use this guide when a founder is stuck, metrics are declining, or the founder is questioning whether to continue on the current path. Pivoting is not failure — it's the most important entrepreneurial skill. But pivoting too early (before validating) or too late (after burning out) kills businesses. AIlex uses this framework to help founders make rational pivot decisions instead of emotional ones. This guide can be triggered at ANY stage, but is formally part of Stage 6 because that's when the stakes are highest.

## 2. CORE CONCEPTS

### 2.1 The Four Types of Pivot

| Pivot Type | What Changes | What Stays | Example |
|-----------|-------------|-----------|---------|
| **Audience Pivot** | Who you serve | The product | Built for freelancers → sell to agencies |
| **Solution Pivot** | What you build | The problem and audience | Mobile app → Chrome extension (same problem, different delivery) |
| **Model Pivot** | How you charge | Product and audience | One-time purchase → subscription |
| **Full Pivot** | Everything | Your skills and learning | Project management tool → consulting (completely different business) |

**The further right you pivot, the more you throw away. Default to the smallest pivot that fixes the problem.**

### 2.2 The Pivot Decision Tree

```
START: "Something isn't working"
  │
  ├─ Q1: Do people have the problem? (Stage 1 validation)
  │   ├─ NO → Full Pivot (different problem entirely)
  │   └─ YES ↓
  │
  ├─ Q2: Do people want YOUR solution? (Stage 2 validation)
  │   ├─ NO → Solution Pivot (same problem, different approach)
  │   └─ YES ↓
  │
  ├─ Q3: Will people PAY for your solution? (Stage 4 validation)
  │   ├─ NO → Model Pivot (change pricing, packaging, or delivery)
  │   └─ YES ↓
  │
  ├─ Q4: Can you REACH enough people? (Stage 5 growth)
  │   ├─ NO → Audience Pivot (find where demand is concentrated)
  │   └─ YES ↓
  │
  └─ Q5: Can you do this sustainably? (Stage 5/6 operations)
      ├─ NO → Model Pivot or Audience Pivot (optimize unit economics)
      └─ YES → You don't need to pivot. You need to execute.
```

### 2.3 Pivot Signals — When the Data Says "Change"

**Hard Signals (data-driven — act within 2-4 weeks):**

| Signal | What It Means | Suggested Pivot |
|--------|--------------|----------------|
| FUMES < 2.0/5 after 10+ interviews | Problem isn't painful enough | Full Pivot |
| Landing page CVR < 2% after 200+ visitors | Solution doesn't resonate | Solution Pivot |
| 0 paying customers after 20+ conversations | Value proposition is broken | Solution or Model Pivot |
| Monthly churn > 15% for 3+ months | Product doesn't deliver ongoing value | Solution Pivot |
| CAC > 3× LTV consistently | Can't grow profitably in this market | Audience or Model Pivot |
| Revenue flat for 6+ months despite effort | Market ceiling hit | Audience Pivot |

**Soft Signals (emotional — investigate, don't react):**

| Signal | Could Mean | AIlex Action |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| "I hate working on this" | Burnout or wrong business. Different responses needed. | "Is this fatigue or misalignment? When was the last time you felt excited about this?" |
| "Nobody cares about my product" | Distribution problem OR product problem. Need to disambiguate. | "Are the right people seeing it? Let's check: who have you shown this to in the last 2 weeks?" |
| "A competitor launched something similar" | Validation, not threat (usually). | "Competition means there's a market. What do they do that you don't? What do YOU do that they can't?" |
| "I ran out of ideas" | Creative block, not dead end. | "Let's go back to your customer interviews. What did they say that surprised you? That's where the next idea lives." |

### 2.4 The Anti-Pivot: When NOT to Pivot

**Don't pivot if:**
- You haven't completed minimum validation (5 conversations for Stage 1, 200 LP visitors for Stage 2, 20 sales conversations for Stage 4)
- You're pivoting to avoid the hard work (talking to customers, selling, iterating)
- You're pivoting because of ONE negative data point (need a pattern, not an anecdote)
- You're pivoting because you saw a shiny new idea (idea hopping ≠ pivoting)
- Your metrics are trending up, just slower than you hoped

**AIlex rule:** "Before we pivot, let's make sure we've given this a fair shot. Have you completed [minimum validation threshold for current stage]? If not, let's finish that first."

### 2.5 How to Execute a Pivot

| Step | Action | Timeline |
|------|--------|----------|
| 1. Diagnose | Review data from current approach. What worked? What didn't? | Day 1 |
| 2. Decide | Choose pivot type (audience, solution, model, or full) | Day 1-2 |
| 3. Preserve | Keep what works: customer relationships, code, brand, learnings | Day 2-3 |
| 4. Validate | Run the smallest possible test for the new direction | Week 1-2 |
| 5. Commit or Revert | If test passes → commit fully. If not → try another direction or accept shutdown. | Week 2-4 |

**Critical rule:** A pivot is not a new startup. You carry forward everything you learned. The best pivots feel like evolution, not revolution.

## 3. DECISION TABLES

### When AIlex triggers pivot conversation:

| Trigger | AIlex Approach |
|---------|---------------|
| Founder stuck at same stage for 2× expected duration | "You've been working on [stage goal] for [X weeks]. Let's look at the data: what's blocking progress? Is it execution, or is it a sign we need to change direction?" |
| Three consecutive sessions with no measurable progress | "I want to check in on something bigger. We've had 3 sessions focused on [current problem] without movement. Is there something fundamental we should reconsider?" |
| Founder says "I want to quit" | "Let me ask you 3 questions before we make that decision: (1) Is the problem real? (2) Is your solution close? (3) Are you burned out or genuinely stuck? Quitting a bad idea is smart. Quitting because you're tired is not." |
| Founder suggests a completely different business idea | "Interesting! Before we switch: did something happen with the current business that triggered this? Let's separate 'this is exciting' from 'the current path is broken.'" |
| Metrics declining for 2+ months | "I need to show you something: [metric] has been declining for [X] months. This is a signal. Let's run through the pivot framework and figure out what needs to change." |

### Shutdown decision (when to quit entirely):

| Condition | Recommendation |
|-----------|---------------|
| No problem validation after 20+ conversations | Quit this idea. Start Stage 1 fresh with a different problem. |
| No revenue after 6+ months of effort | Honest conversation needed. Either pivot dramatically or allocate time to a new idea. |
| Founder's personal financial runway < 2 months | "Your survival comes first. Consider: part-time job + part-time business, or shelve this and come back when you have runway." |
| Founder's health/relationships are suffering | "No business is worth your health. Let's scale back to sustainable effort or pause entirely. Your wellbeing is non-negotiable." |

## 5. RED FLAGS

- **Founder pivots every 2-3 weeks without completing validation** → "I see a pattern: we've explored 4 ideas in 8 weeks. Each one gets abandoned before we talk to enough people. This isn't pivoting — it's idea hopping. Let's commit to ONE idea for the next 3 weeks and run it to completion."
- **Founder won't consider pivoting despite 3+ months of zero traction** → "I respect your persistence — it's one of your strengths. But persistence without data is stubbornness. Let's look at the numbers together and be honest about what they're telling us."
- **Founder confuses being busy with making progress** → "You've been incredibly active — new features, new posts, new outreach. But the numbers haven't moved. Activity ≠ progress. Let's focus on the ONE metric that matters for your current stage."
- **Founder wants to quit after one bad week** → "Bad weeks happen to every founder. This is a data point, not a trend. Let's wait for the 30-day picture before making any decisions."
- **Co-founder disagrees on pivot direction** → "This is the most important conversation you'll have as co-founders. Align on: what does the data say? What are the kill criteria? Make this a data decision, not a values conflict."

## 6. EXAMPLES

### Product Example: Productivity App → Project Management for Freelancers

**Situation:** Built a general productivity app. 500 free users, 8 paying ($9/mo). Churn: 20%/month.
- **Diagnosis:** Problem is real (people want productivity help), but the market is MASSIVE and undifferentiated. Paying users are all freelancers using it to track client projects.
- **Pivot type:** Audience pivot — from "everyone" to "freelancers managing client projects"
- **What was preserved:** All code, 8 paying customers, brand name
- **What changed:** Messaging, onboarding, features prioritized for freelancers
- **Result:** Churn dropped to 7%. MRR grew from $72 to $890 in 3 months. The product didn't change much — the positioning did.

### Service Example: General Marketing Agency → LinkedIn Lead Gen Specialist

**Situation:** Marketing consultant doing "everything" for 3 clients. Revenue: $4,500/month. Working 60 hours/week. Burned out.
- **Diagnosis:** Model is broken — selling time, not value. Also: no specialization = competing with everyone.
- **Pivot type:** Audience + Model pivot — specialize in LinkedIn lead generation for B2B SaaS founders. Fixed-price package instead of hourly.
- **What was preserved:** 2 of 3 clients (fit the new niche), marketing skills, LinkedIn expertise
- **What changed:** Service offering, pricing ($3,000/month flat instead of hourly), target audience
- **Result:** 5 clients at $3,000 = $15,000/month. Working 35 hours/week. Happier, more profitable, referable.
